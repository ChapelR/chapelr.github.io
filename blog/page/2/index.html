        <p>I’m a writer by trade. While I dabble in Twine, programming, and web development, writing is my job and, largely, my passion. For me, Twine is an attractive platform for development not just because of its relative simplicity, but also because of its focus on writing and its output to supremely shareable HTML files. But I think that Twine also has a problem, or blind spot at least, when it comes to a good writing, editing, and rewriting workflow. It’s just not all that easy to iterate on your prose the same way you can iterate on your design, mechanics, and code. </p>
<p>Maybe I’ve been spoiled by technology, but I want to be able to draft, fix, update, and draft more. I want to be able to work on my prose and mark it up with a pen, away from the harsh blue light of my computer screen. I want to be able to write notes about changes I want to make in between editing sessions. I want to be able to share my drafts with my friends for feedback, and get their comments and corrections. </p>
<p>So I made a proofing format called <a href="https://twinelab.net/poof/">poof</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-Old-Ways"><a href="#The-Old-Ways" class="headerlink" title="The Old Ways"></a>The Old Ways</h2><p>I am involved pretty heavily in the Twine community, and most of the Twine authors I work with or help out know I’m a writer. They’re also often writers themselves. When I’m asked to critique one of their stories, they’re often looking for more than just impressions, and I want to give more, too. I want to be able to point to a sentence, word, phrase, and say, “hey, I tripped on this.” </p>
<p>What I typically do is hack the JavaScript a bit via the console to report to me the passage title on every new passage. It’s easier to do in SugarCube, but also possible in Harlowe. Then I open a Google doc, write the passage title in, copy and paste some problem text over, and make a comment in the Google doc, writing my thoughts there. </p>
<p>It’s laborious, boring. While in one sense it gives me a moment to think through my reaction, it also makes the process unappealing in general. </p>
<p>It was this dissatisfaction that first have rise to a desire for a proofing format designed to help me make my own critiquing / editing workflow simpler, faster, and more fun. Making a story format, though, isn’t really something you do in an evening, even for one as simple at its core as poof. But I assumed I could make one, if I was so inclined. Regardless, the idea, while there, wasn’t really formed. </p>
<h2 id="The-Problem-of-Paperthin"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Paperthin" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Paperthin"></a>The Problem of Paperthin</h2><p>Paperthin is a format with a clever name and almost nothing happening under the hood. And that’s not a bad thing, per se. The amount of complexity required from a proofing format is directly correlated to what you expect it to do. Paperthin’s job is to put your passage text together into a single doc for viewing. Nothing more or less. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the critical flaw of Paperthin is the unwise (in my opinion) use of CSS pseudo-elements, specifically, the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element. Paperthin renders each passage’s source code with a <code>::before</code> holding the passage title. In CSS, pseudo-elements are not considered to be part of the document proper. They’re intended to be used as embellishments, icons, etc; things that don’t contribute to the document’s meaning or formatting. When you copy/paste or print the document, these pseudo-elements are omitted. By using these <code>::before</code> pseudo-elements, Paperthin hamstrings its own usefulness. It becomes only a simple, readable copy that you can’t do anything else with. </p>
<p>So as an editing tool, importing a game into Twine a pulling up the proofing copy in Paperthin is less helpful overall than I feel it could be. And Paperthin has no JavaScript or commenting or editing, so as a format for critiquing or iterating on a draft, you’re just wasting time. It’s still easier to hack out the passage name in the console and use a Google doc for the heavy lifting. </p>
<h2 id="Decompiling-to-Twee"><a href="#Decompiling-to-Twee" class="headerlink" title="Decompiling to Twee"></a>Decompiling to Twee</h2><p>There are many ways, including utility formats and third party compilers, to get a story into Twee notation, a plain text format designed for viewing and editing in a text editor. This is a useful feature, and one that wound up being included in poof, but more on my format later. </p>
<p>Many text editors come with spellcheck and other tools that can help you iterate on your prose, but I also think that as a critiquing or editing solution, there are some faults here, the biggest of them being the slowness of implementation. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about the other side of a critique or editing pass for a moment, the part where the original author (who may also be you) goes through the editing notes and weighs and implements the changes. Your editor (who, again, may also be you) just sent you a text dump of your story. Whether they’ve edited directly in the source or added notes, you now need to find every change or suggestion, review it, and decide what to do with it. You’ve been given a haystack full of needles. </p>
<p>While the editing pass was easy, the actual iteration becomes a slog. If you’re doing your own editing, this is less a problem, but only slightly, and that also assumes that your editing pass consists of fixes, not notes, to-do lists, etc. Mine usually consist of both, and I doubt I’m alone in that. </p>
<p>Any effective editing solution requires two major components.  First, changes, notes, and edits must be easy to make; second, changes, notes, and edits must be easy to find, review, and implement.</p>
<h2 id="Yeah-Sure-but-Illume"><a href="#Yeah-Sure-but-Illume" class="headerlink" title="Yeah, Sure, but Illume"></a>Yeah, Sure, but Illume</h2><p>Illume is a proofing format that allows authors to export their edits and changes as diffs, and is frankly an incredible solution. Poof is not really intended to be a replacement for Illume, as what Illume does is pretty great.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, you can use this link to install and check out Illume: <code>https://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/format.js</code>.</p>
<p>Illume allows you to edit passages using a built-in editor, flag them as reviewed, and move on. You can export HTML files with your diffs, and use these files as a guide to your reviewing and editing process. Like poof, Illume also allows for a great deal of export options, and has ignore tags.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use Illume or poof will likely come down to preference. I have nothing but nice things to say about Illume, but I did develop poof anyhow, and for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think importable / exportable comments are a better solution for editing <em>another</em> author’s work. I think Illume is a superior format for iterating on your <em>own</em> prose, but I think being able to import comments from files makes it easier to work in larger teams, with more people, etc. This isn’t to say you <em>can’t</em> do this in Illume, only that I feel, personally, that being able to collect comments from multiple sources into a single poof view makes poof ideal for this specific use-case.  </li>
<li>I think poof offers a different (though not necessarily better) toolset. While you can organize, find, and, filter passages with Illume, the focus of Illume is overwhelmingly on moving each passage from the “needs reviewed” list to the “reviewed” list.  Poof has a similar filtering option; you can filter passages by whether they have comments or don’t, meaning after you’re done reviewing a passage, you can throw a comment on it that just says “done” or something, even if you don’t think the passage needs a change.  </li>
<li>In a similar vein to both of these, I think poof is just less <em>opinionated</em> than Illume. It makes fewer assumptions about how you want to edit, who you are in relation to the project you’re editing, and how you want to spend your editing time. This means that poof has some benefits for some people compared to Illume, but also pales in comparison in other areas. Being less opinionated means that poof is less specialized and more generic.</li>
</ol>
<p>What proofing format is right for you isn’t a call I can make, and while I think that Illume is incredible, I also designed poof because it more closely reflects my own desires and editing habits. If you edit like me–that it with notes and comments first, then rewrites, then more notes, then more rewrites, poof will probably fit your habits. If you prefer diving into edits right away, Illume will give you more bang for your buck. I think in either case, managing multiple comment sets is easier than managing multiple diff files, so I think if you’re working in a team, or sending your comments to another author, poof is worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="Iterating-on-Prose"><a href="#Iterating-on-Prose" class="headerlink" title="Iterating on Prose"></a>Iterating on Prose</h2><p>From this point on, we’re going to focus on poof, and some ways I think you can use it to help iterate on your prose. We’re not going to talk about Paperthin or Illume anymore; compare these proofing formats yourself and reach your own conclusions based on your needs.</p>
<p>Before we get too far ahead, let me clarify a term I’ve been using. They sound jargon-y, and I think I want to make sure we’re on the same page. So what do I mean by “iterating on your prose” anyway.</p>
<p>When I write, I waste no time concerning myself with quality on a first draft. To me, drafting is about words on a page, not perfection. It’s about the finish line, and generating something that can be refined later. Even if you don’t do this, your first draft will be garbage. It needs to be iterated on.</p>
<p>Iteration is the process of taking something, using it as a blueprint, and building something better with it. Your drafts are not your story, but a guide to what your story will ultimately become, through a process of editing, taking notes, and rewriting: iteration. Your prose will never be perfect. Instead, the process of iterating will become less effective until it is no longer worth the time.</p>
<p>This is how I approach writing, and how most of the writers I know do as well, though some to a lesser or greater extent. You don’t <em>need</em> to write like this to use poof or get something out of it, but I think it helps to understand my process to understand why poof is designed the way it is.</p>
<h2 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h2><p>In poof, comments are the primary way you’ll interact with your prose. You can click the pencil icon to create a comment that contains all the passage text of the indicated passage to make edits, or create a new comment to leave notes, ideas, and suggestions. These comments are portable, meaning you can create a bunch of comments, then export a comment file to share with another poof-using person. This person can then import your comments into their poof view, and your comments will be added to any comments that are already there. This means you can use comments from a variety of collaborators, editors, or friends and see them all in one view, and delete them as you address them.</p>
<p>You can filter out passages that have or don’t have comments to help keep you on track. You can also search through and sort passages by a variety of metrics, so you can easily be playing a Twine game in one window, and commenting up those passages in poof in another, without having to hack the game to find the passage title: just filter by passage text.</p>
<p>Comments aren’t a perfect solution to everything: sometimes you just need a diff view like one powered by Illume, so you can create and export your edits. But as a general use way of taking note, recording reactions, and suggesting changes or edits, comments work pretty well, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Features"><a href="#Other-Features" class="headerlink" title="Other Features"></a>Other Features</h2><p>Finding and commenting on passages is probably the best use of poof, but a number of other useful features are included.  Here’s a quick breakdown of what else you have at your fingertips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export to PDF format to print and share. PDF format renders a very shareable copy of your passage content, and one that won’t look crappy if you want a physical copy to mark up with a pen.  </li>
<li>Export to Twee notation. As mentioned, poof can export to Twee, so you don’t need to get a format or compiler just for that.  </li>
<li>Export a Twine archive. Twine’s archive option archives <em>all</em> of your stories. You can use this option to generate a much, much smaller archive to create a backup of youor work.  </li>
<li>View modes. Poof comes with a variety of viewing options, including a simplified mode, a night mode, and more, all designed to help you get comfy and settle in for some reading.  </li>
<li>You can use a special passage to configure poof’s default settings, fonts, etc, and can tag certain passages to be ignores by poof.  </li>
<li>You can also view your JavaScript and CSS code with poof.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-Poof-Powered-Editing-Workflow"><a href="#A-Poof-Powered-Editing-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="A Poof-Powered Editing Workflow"></a>A Poof-Powered Editing Workflow</h2><p>As a sort of sign-off, here’s some ideas I had while building poof. When you develop anything as complex as this, it helps to think about what you want and expect users to do with it. As I worked on poof, I thought about how I would want to use it, and how it could be used. Here’s a few examples of how you might build an editing or critiquing workflow using poof based on those design ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> </p>
<p>You’re playing a game a fellow Twine author asked you to critique, and as you go you have comments, suggestions, and ideas. You import the game into your preferred compiler and open it in poof. As you play, you search for and find the passages you want with poof’s finding and filtering tools and make comments, then export the comment file and send it to the author.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> </p>
<p>You’re making a game with another dev, either as an editor or sharing the writing load, and need a quick way to share ideas and comments. You can “trade” comment files to see each other’s thoughts and make plans. While this is really no alternative to version control, opening issues on a repo is nowhere near as effective as a means for sharing writing ideas. </p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<p>You want your non-Twine-using friend to give you feedback on your writing for a Twine game. Assuming they sufficiently understand the concepts of CYOA-style IF and passages, you could create a PDF export and send it to them. They can then import this file into Google Drive and create comments, or print it and mark it up.</p>
<h2 id="The-Future"><a href="#The-Future" class="headerlink" title="The Future"></a>The Future</h2><p>Poof is still in a pre-release state, currently at version 0.3.2. This means poof isn’t done by a long shot. I considered adding diffs similar to Illume, but there’s little chance such an addition will ever be as fully-featured and well-designed as Illume: it will always be an after-thought at this point. While poof is <em>largely</em> feature-complete, there’s still a few bells and whistles and adjustments to be made, and if there’s something you want to see in a future version, <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/poof/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise an issue at the repo</a>.</p>
<p>Note that poof isn’t going to do a complete 180 at this point. Future development on poof is unlikely to change the direction of the project, so if you’re not a fan or prefer another proofing format, there’s a pretty low chance that poof is going to set your world on fire in a later version. But I am open to hearing what you think it could do better anyhow, if you’ve got the time to talk.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty pleased with how this project turned out, but there’s a lot of room for improvement, especially internally. Now that version 0.3.2 is up and most major bugs have been fixed and patched, I’ll probably be taking a week or two off before diving into the 0.4.0 verison, though I will certainly patch bugs if needed.</p>

        <h2 id="Options-Are-Always-Best"><a href="#Options-Are-Always-Best" class="headerlink" title="Options Are Always Best"></a>Options Are Always Best</h2><p>Here’s a bit of wisdom I sort of stumbled on all by myself that you can use to make your game better: if you can make something into an option or setting, you should. If you want to, for example, have quick time events, give the user a way to shut them off. You may feel they’re integral to your game, and they really might be, but at the end of the day, all it takes is a <em>not recommended</em> next to the switch to tell users they risk having a subpar experience while still letting users with, say, disabilities a chance to at least play your game. </p>
<p>I think the best way to handle pronouns is similar: inconvenience no one, but throw in as much configuration as you can. I don’t need to worry about this for <em>Holy Land</em>, since the player takes the role of static characters, but I was faced with the issue in <em>Deep Dive</em>. I solved it by creating a completely configurable system with “presets” for common pronoun sets, and it wound up looking like this. </p>

<h2 id="The-Fine-Line"><a href="#The-Fine-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Fine Line"></a>The Fine Line</h2><p>I’m cisgender myself, so I tend to always want to think of male and female as “normal”. It’s a view that, while I won’t make excuses for, is ingrained in our culture in ways that make it hard to be mindful of. I think that designers need to be mindful of their own particular biases and presuppositions. It’s not enough to just try not to be a racist, for example. Racism is socially and culturally embedded. The magical black janitor of wisdom is as racist a caricature as black face. If we ever feel that we aren’t influenced by a particular cultural bias, then we must be even <em>more</em> vigilant, because we’re either not affected by it, as we suppose, or we’re affected so much that it feels like a natural state. </p>
<p>In short, not thinking you’re sexist won’t do you much good when you’ve penned yet another manic pixie dream girl whose only purpose is wish-fulfillment, even if you did it with the best of intentions. In this era, not being at least overtly racist or sexist is by some people considered a virtue, but this is like comparing yourself to a child to feel strong.</p>
<p>But this is really beside the point. The point I want to make is that I’m cisgender, and I know in my heart that I think of being cisgender as some sort of “default”.  That’s not something I feel great about, but as long as I’m aware of my bias, I can work against it and maybe even change it someday. And I know that when I go about making something, anything, I need to be wary of myself above all else. </p>
<p>The biggest question is always: when does my desire to be inclusive start warping into tokenism or patronization? The answer is not something you’ll find without help. </p>
<p>So when you’re putting together something like this, ask your transgender friends. They’ll help you find a balance. If you don’t have any (or at least aren’t sure if you do), or if you don’t feel comfortable asking them, or if you just want more opinions, try <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/asktransgender on reddit</a>. </p>
<p>Remember, you aren’t being heard right now; that comes later, when your piece is published. For now, listen. </p>
<h2 id="Pushback"><a href="#Pushback" class="headerlink" title="Pushback"></a>Pushback</h2><p>Sometimes inclusiveness has an actual cost. If you’re recording 1000s of lines of dialog like you’re making a BioWare game, then flexible pronouns will become a pipe dream fast. </p>
<p>In other situations, a game may require gender-based mechanics that just don’t lend themselves well to non-binary gender representation. Take <em>Mount &amp; Blade</em>, where playing a female character makes for a more challenging and interesting experience. Should being transgender make it even harder? Easier if you’re identifying as male? Transgender and intersex people have always existed, but implementing them in this sort of historically sexist context quickly becomes a challenge from a design perspective. </p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that the whole goal of creating a more open-ended pronoun system isn’t for political correctness, or at least it isn’t <em>just</em> about that. Likewise, few players will outright refuse to play a game solely based on whether you allow them to represent themselves well in it, so it’s not really about pandering either. Instead, the goal of something like this is to aid your game, deepen immersion, and allow players to have some level of control over their experience in your world.  In a medieval game, for example, pronouns like ‘xe’ may help some players feel more immersed, but for others, even ones who use those pronouns, it can feel forced and immersion-breaking to hear something so modern pop out of a 13th century king’s mouth.  As they say, there’s no accounting for taste. But you can let the player make that choice.</p>
<p>There’s also another elephant in the room, particularly when it comes to games. Some people take issue with increased inclusivity. As with the above, sometimes the reasons are justified, at least somewhat. Tokenism doesn’t do much for anyone, and a lot of games are more concerned about scoring points (pun very much intended) with a certain demographic than they are actual representation. That’s how Hollywood wound up with all those magical wise black men. Actual representation, contrary to popular thought, feels real, like it always was meant to be there. That’s unlikely to score points with anyone. It just feels natural, right. But it also it also serves your story and your audience by painting a world that fits itself together and fills in all of its own cracks. It presents your audience with a version of reality they can map to real life and actual experience.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you do it right, most people won’t realize you’re doing anything at all. Sounds awful, right? All that work, just to be invisible. And yet for the author or designer, invisible is the goal. The hand of the author moving the pieces about, pulling the strings, making the marionettes dance, if they can see it all, you’ve failed. </p>
<p>But I digress, this is becoming more of a general inclusivity discussion than one arguing the merits of pronoun configuration.</p>
<h2 id="Every-Desicision-Is-an-Argument"><a href="#Every-Desicision-Is-an-Argument" class="headerlink" title="Every Desicision Is an Argument"></a>Every Desicision Is an Argument</h2><p>This post isn’t titled “Pronouns”, its “Pronouns and Game Settings”. So let’s back up a bit. I mentioned already that in <em>Holy Land</em>, the player controls static characters that already exists. So I guess a certain reading of my above arguments could cause some readers to arrive at the conclusion that I’m a hypocrite. After all, if giving players options is good, then certainly not letting them make their own characters is bad, or at least less good. After all, with a few lines of code, I could replace these static characters with variables defined by the player, right? The answer is that yes, I could. In fact, the only reason <em>Holy Land</em> doesn’t allow character creation is because I made it that way. There is a lot of character customization, so adding a whole creation feature would not be a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Authors have control over their work, not the other way around. Some people, even creators, seem to hold fast to the ridiculous idea that they need to be true to their inspiration or goals at the expense of almost anything else, like some other-worldy muse-like being planted ideas in their head and their greatest duty in life is to create what has been given to them with the utmost precision. George R.R. Martin writes a lot of rapes into <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. The excellent TV show <em>Orphan Black</em> features a murder scene late in the series that is shockingly and unnecessarily brutal. And so on. If you have misgivings, you’re a prude or, even worse, trying to <strong>censor everyone and kill art, you damned moral guardian</strong>. But the truth is that the creators are responsible for every decision they make, and every line of dialog, every design choice, every sentence is an argument for its own existence.  Sometimes these are good arguments, sometimes they’re not as good.  Sometimes, we just don’t buy it. If you’ve ever watched a movie or read a book and feel like something just didn’t work or didn’t belong, then you’ve encountered one of these bad arguments; they take you out of the experience.  You start thinking about the author or the produciton team or the culture surrounding the work instead of the characters and world of that work.</p>
<p>You can sacrifice a lot of things on the altar of player agency. You can also sacrifice a lot of things in the name of authorial intent or artistic license. <em>Dark Souls</em> doesn’t have an easy mode because it was sacrificed on the latter. <em>Skyrim</em>‘s story is a bit weak because it was sacrificed on the former. Your job is to make those sacrifices. The important thing is whether the sacrifice justifies itself, and there’s no clean way to measure that; in most cases, different people will have different opinions.</p>
<p>So if you can’t tell the story you need to tell with player-created characters, you’re going to need to hope, like I do with <em>Holy Land</em>, that most players will be swayed by the arguments presented. </p>
<h2 id="Everyone-Hates-Quick-Time-Events"><a href="#Everyone-Hates-Quick-Time-Events" class="headerlink" title="Everyone Hates Quick Time Events"></a>Everyone Hates Quick Time Events</h2><p>For this last little tidbit before I disappear to continue working on <em>Holy Land</em>‘s combat engine, let’s talk about player agency and settings one more time, and the fear that many authors, myself to some extent included, have about them. It’s that options for the player always lead to a direct loss of author control.</p>
<p>Let’s look at quick time events again to illustrate this, and we’ll say that your game has a few tense sequences that use them. For you, as the author, these quick time events create tension; they make the scene work and feel exhilarating. But you know that if there’s an option to shut them off, many players will do so before even giving them a chance, because these mechanics are often frustrating to some players. So you have a choice: give an option and risk the entire scene, maybe the entire game, falling flat, or don’t give an option and risk having some players be unable or unwilling to play.</p>
<p>In this case, you need to think about a few things before you decide.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the whole scene feels less tense without the quick time events, maybe you’re using them as a crutch.  Maybe the real problem is that the scene needs to be improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s tempting to think of yourself or your game as the exception to any given rule, but most players just won’t see it that way, no matter how good a job you’ve done. We know that quick time events are generally unpopular, and we know that the reason is because they’re usually set up like binary choices, but everyone knows which one is the “right” choice, eliminating any real agency. On top of that, they’re frustrating when they lead directly to a game over. I would recommend making sure that your quick time events, at least, really are exceptional. If you’ve done it right, they will improve your game. Players may still not give them a chance, but at least those who do will be pleasantly surprised.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it really worth making this decision for the player? I have a few disabled friends who like to game, and for most of them, the quick time event isn’t just annoying or unpopular, it’s impossible (especially those of the “mashing” variety). Quick time events could be cut from most games without altering the overall gameplay, feel, or appeal, and would instantly improve accessibility, letting even more players play. Accessiblity is always worth the work in my opinion, and in this case, worth the risk of a few players having a lesser experience because they wanted to faff about in the options menu before starting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Players know what they need from a game better than you do. Letting them make those choices is usually going to improve your game.</p>
<h2 id="Back-to-the-Grind"><a href="#Back-to-the-Grind" class="headerlink" title="Back to the Grind"></a>Back to the Grind</h2><p>As always, take my two cents here as just that. No one knows your game and what it needs better than you do, and there are no design decisions that will always be right for every project. As for me, I think that letting people play on their own terms to the extent possible without sacrificing your game’s identity is a balance to strive for, even if it’s usually hard to achieve perfectly.</p>
<p>I want to make a few quick notes about this blog post, and what I’ll be writing in the future. Writing a tightly edited, pointed post is usually ideal, but writing in a more stream-of-consiousness style, moving between points on related issues, and taking a few detours here and there helps me write faster and is also more interesting to me as a means of unloading my thoughts about a topic. This post is sort of a good case in point: it’s a bit rambly and long, and I do occasionally get into tangents or make generalizations. But I find this sort of post easier, faster, and generally more entertaining to write. In the future, I want to try to capture things I’ve been thinking about and working on in this way.</p>
<p>My hope is that this will make for somewhat interesting reading, too, but my primary goal will always be to write about something I want to talk about and get off my chest. I love a good argument or debate, too, so if I’m totally wrong about anything, feel free to let me know (in a respectful manner).</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>Hello world!</p>
<p>TwineLab.net is going to be my new home on the web.  I also decided to move my blog off of the blogger platform and onto Hexo, which has been an interesting journey, to say the least.  Very easy to mess up, but also easier to configure, even if I haven’t done a lot of configuration just yet.</p>
<p>I plan to try to write more blog posts going forward, but it is a hard sell.  I write for a living, and under a different name, so any time I spend blogging is time I spend both not working on my own projects, and not getting paid.  But blogging is good for the soul, and I feel like I lead a bit of a double life anymore; my Twine and non-Twine work seldom ever interact; people who want me for non-Twine projects don’t want to hear about Twine and vice-versa.  But Twine has become a part of my life in a fairly large way, and it seems wise to give that part of my life more space to vent.</p>
<p>So here we are.  TwineLab is going to be dedicated to my Twine adventures.  I may occasionally cross over between my Twine and non-Twine work in the future and post about those things here, but for now, this seems the best way to scream into the void.</p>
<p><del>There is one important caveat here, though.  All of TwineLab is client-side, with no server or backend.  That means no comments.  If you need to talk to me, seek me out as mentioned <a href="http://twinelab.net/about.html">here</a>.</del> Never mind.</p>
<p>Also note that I’ve decided (at least for now) not to faff about with Google analytics.  So I have no idea if anyone will be reading this.  For that reason, if you are reading this and you see a disappointing lull in content, reach out to me and let me know.</p>
