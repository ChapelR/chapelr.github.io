    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This is a pretty big update, so we’re gonna break this all into chunks and go through it piece-by-piece. As a brief overview, the changes are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Three brand new macros / macro sets / scripts. </li>
<li>One additional system from v1.x of the collection has been rewritten and re-added: the cycles system. </li>
<li>Several scripts have been refactored to better adhere to best practices, improve performance, and rise to my evolving standard for code quality. These changes are internal and shouldn’t effect you as a user. </li>
<li>The documentation has been improved, and the collection how has a dedicated web page at <a href="https://macros.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://macros.twinelab.net</a> </li>
<li>A <a href="https://twinelab.net/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/demo/">demo project</a> to show off the basic functionality of each system. </li>
<li>Finally, a <a href="https://twinelab.net/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/#/changelog">changelog</a> has been added so that changes can be tracked more easily. The v2.3.0 update represents the biggest update since v2.0.0, so it seemed wise to start documenting these changes more clearly. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="New-Systems"><a href="#New-Systems" class="headerlink" title="New Systems"></a>New Systems</h2><p>I’ve added a <code>&lt;&lt;css&gt;&gt;</code> macro that lets authors programmatically customize the CSS style rules of elements on the page. This is still the <em>worst</em> way to change CSS, but it is useful in certain scenarios. </p>
<p>The next addition is the meters macro set. It gives authors access to fully customizable meters for things like health bars, timers, and progress bars, all in SugarCube macro code. It has a few stipulations and limitations you need to be aware of to make good use of it, but I think it works well for what it is. It also includes a JavaScript API if you’re into that sort of thing. </p>
<p>The final addition are the pronoun templates, a complete, drop-in pronoun configuration system for SugarCube leveraging the brand new <code>Template</code> API and syntax, and it can plug in to the <code>Setting</code> API as well. </p>
<h2 id="The-Cycles-System-v2"><a href="#The-Cycles-System-v2" class="headerlink" title="The Cycles System v2"></a>The Cycles System v2</h2><p>The new cycles system is similar to, but better, than the old implementation. Code written for the old system will not be compatible with this one. Check the docs for more on how the new system works and how you may need to update your code. </p>
<p>The only other system that is worth bringing forward to v2 is the consumables inventory system. If I do so, it will be as an extension to the existing Simple Inventory v2.x system. </p>
<h2 id="Refactored-Scripts"><a href="#Refactored-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Refactored Scripts"></a>Refactored Scripts</h2><p>The Simple Inventory, the Playtime system, the operations API (the dice roller and fairmath systems), and the fullscreen macros have all been refactored. Only the fullscreen macros and operations API have seen any end-user changes, in the form of a proper JavaScript-facing API for the former and support for Fate/Fudge dice for the latter (e.g., <code>&quot;2dF&quot;</code>). That said, all of these systems should now be more stable and perform better, and their code should conform better to best practices. </p>
<h2 id="Documentation-Changes"><a href="#Documentation-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Documentation Changes"></a>Documentation Changes</h2><p>In addition to a shiny new website, much of the documentation has been clarified, improved, and fixed and several new examples have been added to several pages, while previously undocumented features have stabilized and been documented. </p>
<p>You don’t <em>need</em> to re-read any of the docs, as none of the changes are specifically breaking. </p>
<h2 id="The-Demo-Project"><a href="#The-Demo-Project" class="headerlink" title="The Demo Project"></a>The Demo Project</h2><p>The demo project includes demonstrations and examples of the <em>basic</em> usage of each system, and provides source code for each example passage, so that users can see how exactly each example is put together on the code side. </p>
<p>Links to the demo and each relevant passage are in the documentation. </p>
<h2 id="The-Changelog"><a href="#The-Changelog" class="headerlink" title="The Changelog"></a>The Changelog</h2><p>The changelog is mostly accurate to my recollection, though there may be some gaps or inconsistencies between it and the repo’s commit history. Since I typically only create releases when a system is retired, given the nature of this project, some changes that happened over short periods of time or weren’t given specific version numbers (e.g., fixed typos in the docs) have been retroactively bundled together and given a version number. </p>
<p>Going forward, I intend to follow semantic versioning a little more closely for the sake of everyone’s sanity. </p>
<h2 id="Other-News"><a href="#Other-News" class="headerlink" title="Other News"></a>Other News</h2><ul>
<li>My proofing format, <a href="https://poof.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poof</a>, has received a big update as well <a href="https://twinelab.net/blog/2019/06/24/poof-1-3-0/">in v1.3.0</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://hal.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAL (my Harlowe audio library)</a> has received an update for better compatibility with Harlowe 3 <a href="https://twinelab.net/blog/2019/06/25/hal-1-3-0/">in v1.3.0</a>. </li>
<li>My episodic fiction framework for the web, <a href="https://serious.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serious</a>, has reached <a href="https://twinelab.net/blog/2019/06/21/serious-1-0-1/">v1.0.0</a>. </li>

</ul>
<h2 id="Coming-Soon"><a href="#Coming-Soon" class="headerlink" title="Coming Soon"></a>Coming Soon</h2><ul>
<li>My <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/tweego-installer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweego-installer</a> will get its bundled formats updated in the coming month or so; I expect a v1 release of Chapbook and a new Harlowe version to be on the way soon, so I will wait for a bit before updating it’s SugarCube version to 2.29.0. </li>
<li>Once more compilers adopt the new <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twee3 specification</a>, poof’s default Twee encoding method will be set to Twee3. Chapbook support will also be forthcoming, but probably later in the year. </li>
<li>I’m investigating issues with HAL’s functionality on mobile devices, particularly iOS. If you’ve encountered weird behavior from HAL on mobiles, please comment on <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/harlowe-audio/issues/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a>. </li>

        <p>This version of HAL comes with a few important updates for greater compatibility with Harlowe 3, and fixes you’ll want even if you’ve stuck to Harlowe 2. </p>
<p>The biggest addition is that HAL now preserves and restores it’s own state separately from Harlowe. In Harlowe 2, reloading the browser simply restarted the game, and this restarted HAL along with it. Loading a saved game had no meaningful effect on HAL. In Harlowe 3, browser reloads now preserve Harlowe’s state, but not in a way similar to loading a saved game. Instead, Harlowe reconstructs the history in a different way that completely ignores startup passages, meaning HAL tracks, playlists, and groups set up in such passages break even though the game itself is fine, and this failure was not handled well. </p>
<p>Now, HAL will attempt to preserve it’s own state and restore it. This preservation only applies to tracks, playlists, and groups, and restores the ability of authors to use startup passages with these features. </p>
<p>The menu API, however, cannot be easily serialized, and therefore must always be defined in user scripts. </p>
<p>It is still gently recommended that you try to stick to Story JavaScript as much as possible, but this change should make it so you no longer <em>have</em> to rewrite code that was valid for Harlowe 2. </p>
<p>Some other bug fixes, updates, and internal improvements are also included in this release, so it’s recommended you update even if the above problem wasn’t an issue for you. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>I will continue monitoring issue and clashes with Harlowe v3 and look into reported issues on mobile devices.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.3.0 has arrived. In addition to dozens of small changes and improvements, the big news here is <em>passage references</em> and an updated Twee encoder.</p>
<p>A passage reference is, as you may imagine, when one of your passages references another passage through a link, include/display, or goto. Poof will parse SugarCube and Harlowe stories for a certain subset of common macros used to transition passages as well as for markup links (e.g., <code>[[links like this]]</code>). The macros parsed are not exhaustive–for example, SugarCube’s <code>&lt;&lt;textbox&gt;&gt;</code> macro can send users to new passages, but is not parsed by poof because there has to be a cutoff somewhere. JavaScript functions and methods that transition passages are also not parsed. Additionally, poof can only parse <em>string literals</em>. So, <code>&lt;&lt;link &#39;Next&#39; &#39;some passage&#39;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;</code> will work, but <code>&lt;&lt;link &#39;Next&#39; $somePassage&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;</code> will not.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things poof will try to parse for valid passage references in each format:</p>
<h4 id="All-Formats"><a href="#All-Formats" class="headerlink" title="All Formats"></a>All Formats</h4><ul>
<li>Markup links of any kind, including arrow markup links (<code>[[passage&lt;-text]]</code>).</li>
<li>Setter links. Even though these are only supported by default by SugarCube, poof will try to parse setter links when it sees them regardless of the format.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Harlowe"><a href="#Harlowe" class="headerlink" title="Harlowe"></a>Harlowe</h4><ul>
<li><code>(link-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(click-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(link-reveal-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(include:)</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="SugarCube"><a href="#SugarCube" class="headerlink" title="SugarCube"></a>SugarCube</h4><ul>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;link&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;button&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;goto&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;display&gt;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Poof will display passage references to and from each passage as links you can click to zoom to those passages, allowing you to essentially play along with your game while editing. This is my solution to requests for a “play order” sorting method.</p>
<p>Note that parsing for passage references is somewhat slow. You cna shut this feature off if you’d prefer faster load times to having it via <code>poof.config</code>.</p>
<p>The second change here is the Twee encoder. Poof now exports to classic Twee, the Twee2 version of Twee (previously unsupported) and <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new Twee3 spec</a>. This last spec is still a draft and is widely unsupported, so the default is still set to Twee classic for now. You can change the Twee encoder in the <code>poof.config</code> special passage.</p>
<p>The smaller changes included in this update are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a starting passage tool to quickly zoom you to the starting passage,</li>
<li>updates to SugarCube globals for the linter,</li>
<li>a bunch of other internal and code-side improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Eventually Twee3 will be the default Twee encoder. SugarCube is also undergoing fairly major changes in v2.29.0, so I’ll be updating poof’s SugarCube support a lot. This will mostly be maintenance though.</p>
<h2 id="Note-on-Twine-v2-3-2"><a href="#Note-on-Twine-v2-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Note on Twine v2.3.2:"></a>Note on Twine v2.3.2:</h2><p>Twine v2.3.2 currently has a bug in how it handles proofing formats, see <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a>. This means if you want to use poof, you need to use an older version of Twine 2 until this gets sorted out.</p>

        <p>Serious has been officially released.</p>
<p>For the unaware (most people I imagine), Serious is my software framework for creating serialized web fiction. You can read more <a href="https://serious.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://twinelab.net/blog/2019/01/15/serious/">here</a>.</p>
<p>While there’s still some rough patches, I think I’m at least generally happy with how it works. A guide for authors and non-programmers will be coming at some point. I’m tossing around the idea of some sort of Twine integration that will allow you to use Twine/Twee as an editor for Serious stories; in this case, passages will be mapped to episodes and meta posts, but this idea is purely theoretical at the moment. I may create a bare-bones markdown editor in NW.js that compiles to Serious instead, but both honestly feel like a lot of work for minimal payoff.</p>
<p>Regardless, let me know what you think if you’re interested, either via comments here or issues in the relevant repositories.</p>
<h2 id="In-Other-News"><a href="#In-Other-News" class="headerlink" title="In Other News"></a>In Other News</h2><p>I’ve been busy lately; here’s some of the things I’ve been working on.</p>
<p>I’ve created a curated list of Twine resources. Check it out <a href="https://resources.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>A new version of poof is in the works. This one is gonna have some pretty major additions.</p>
<p>My custom macro collection is getting its biggest single update since the overhaul to v2. Several new macros, refactored code, a complete demo file, and more. The release of the new version of the collection will probably coincide with the next release of SugarCube, since some of the systems rely on new features in the pipeline.</p>
<p>I have unfortunately not been spending much time on <em>Holy Land</em> lately, but a beta of <em>Deep Dive</em> is in the cards for later this year, and it will be coming to IFComp this year unless something crazy happens. Wish me luck!</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.2.0 is here (already). This version ties up some loose ends in the re-implemented PDF export feature.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you’re having trouble with updating, grab the new link from the <a href="https://poof.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poof documentation</a>. I’ve updated the link there to always, always grab the latest stable version.</p>
<p>You now have options (configurable by the <code>poof.config</code> special passage) to control some basic styles of the generated PDF. First, you can select from one of three basic fonts: a serif option (Georgia), a sans-serif option (Roboto), and a monospace option (Consolas). Because the PDF export process requires fonts to be loaded as base-64 data into a “virtual file system”, the best I can do is provide basic options. Having three inoffensive options from the main font categories seemed like the wisest choice. Users can now also specify font sizes, the options are <code>very small</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>normal</code>, <code>large</code>, and <code>very large</code>. Normal is 12-point, very small is 8-point and very large is 16-point. The final option given is one for line height (or line spacing, if you prefer). You can set this option to a value between <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, with <code>1</code> being single-spaced and <code>2</code> being double-spaced. The defaul line height is <code>1.15</code>.</p>
<p>The style options provided above are all the low-hanging fruit I could manage. Since the new implementation generates a PDF on the fly from the HTML data, rather than generating a canvas image from the same, the styling options are fairly limited; it’s not as simple as recreating what appears on the screen anymore. In other words, we lost line numbers but gained copy/paste. And I’m alright with that. The simpler structure should be nicer for printers anyway. As always, though, if you want more, let me know and I’ll see if it’s at least possible.</p>
<p>In addition, a the loading screen is now called when a PDF generates. For short projects, you’ll see nothing at all, maybe a flash. For lengthier projects, the process can take several seconds or more, and messing with the filtering or sorting during this process is probably unwise, so I decided to lock out the screen completely instead of risking that happening. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen or so seconds to generate the PDF, even in novel-length projects, but the speed of the operation will vary from machine to machine and browser to browser. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Poof is going back on my maintenance shelf for now. I’m pleased with the new PDF implementation as it’s been a net positive all across the format, and getting the Twee encoder to respect filter and sort was something I was happy to knock out along the way. But other than those things, I don’t think there’s much more that needs to be done here.</p>
<p>I’ll be on the lookout for bugs, problems, and feature requests, as always.</p>
<h2 id="In-a-future-version-made-by-someone-smarter-than-me"><a href="#In-a-future-version-made-by-someone-smarter-than-me" class="headerlink" title="In a future version made by someone smarter than me:"></a>In a future version made by someone smarter than me:</h2><p>I jest, but I’ve been asked about implementing a “play order” sorting method. While this is theoretically possible, the only real way to do it would be to load up the story format engine in question, crawl the file somehow, and then interpret that order in a way that could be meaningfully sorted. I’m open to ideas, but I don’t believe this is possible–even parsing just the markup links in each passage to construct a rough order would be expensive performance-wise and time-consuming to implement. Not to mention that it wouldn’t really return a reliable play order. It’s an interesting problem, but I can’t think of a solution, outside using passage naming conventions, like numbers, in the first place.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.1.0 is now out. To use the new version, simply reinstall it from the CDN, or download the file from the same. </p>
<p>This version makes only a few critical but small changes to some of the export options. </p>
<p>First, the PDF export has been simplified. It now requires an Internet connection on first use to cache the scripts used, but the format file has been made significantly smaller (from ~580KB down to ~170KB) Additionally, the PDF export will now no longer generate a blank file on large stories. </p>
<p>The Twee exporter has also been rewritten to respect sort and filter options, so the resulting Twee file is now representive of what’s on screen, not what’s in the data chunk. </p>
<p>The trade-off is that both of these export options now take longer and use more resources, but I believe the benefits largely outweigh the heftier performance. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>As always I’ll be monitoring for bugs and problems. I will probably add some styling options to <code>poof.config</code> for the PDF export, like fonts, font size, and maybe line height and spacing.</p>

        <p>Long live… meh. </p>
<p>Anyway, when I first started working on Holy Land, and in Twine, I ran my related web presence through the aforementioned site, including my old blog. Since I’ve, shall we say, branched out, I decided to make this website, where I can park <em>all</em> my Twine and coding related stuff. </p>
<p>The only thing that hasn’t transitioned over is my old blog. While its possible for me to get those old posts and put them here, I’ve instead decided to make them available via archives.twinelab.net for now. That link will forward you automatically to the old Holy Land Devlog Blogger site, if you’re interested. </p>
<p>This also means that some old links may stop working. They’ve been fixed on my site and around my GitHub repos, but there isn’t much I can do about elsewhere. </p>
<p>There’s a few major benefits to the changes over to twinelab.net, the new blogging software, and the cleaned up web site here, but that’s for another day. </p>
<p>That’s all I have to say for now; I just wanted to clear up any potential confusion. </p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve just released an alpha-ish version of <a href="http://twinelab.net/serious">Serious</a>, a project I’ve been working on for quite some time. Serious generates static websites from markdown, and there’s nothing really special about that, and that’s sort of the tale of Serious in general. It’s <em>specific</em> and narrow in scope. So let’s try to figure out why Serious exists, who it’s for, and whether I’ve wasted all of my time.</p>
<h2 id="Serial-Fiction"><a href="#Serial-Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Serial Fiction"></a>Serial Fiction</h2><p>I’ve been wanting to get into writing a web serial for literal years. Initially I planned to use Blogger, or some other online blogging software, but what immediately struck me about those platforms was just how annoying it was to present structured, ordered content, particularly in an earliest-to-latest fashion. The only real thing you could do was create a hand-edited page on the site that collected all the episodes, in order, as links. So no excerpts or pretty stuff. Even next and previous buttons didn’t really work so well. They were there, sure, but often lost in a sea of suggestions, tags, similar posts–even ads.</p>
<p>I never did write any serial fiction, and the idea kind of died off. It’s possible on a blogging platform, but you really are fighting the platform on this one. Not only are you getting a lot of things you don’t need, but the things you do need are kludges and amateurish link-lists.</p>
<h2 id="AO3-and-FictionPress"><a href="#AO3-and-FictionPress" class="headerlink" title="AO3 and FictionPress"></a>AO3 and FictionPress</h2><p>I sort of forgot about <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FictionPress</a> (and its big brother, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanFiction.net</a>) at the time I was looking into doing a serial. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AO3 (Archive of Our Own)</a> wasn’t around yet; it’s a newer but very similar take on what the other two were doing. A few years later, maybe 2012-ish I wanted to try my hand at serial fiction again. I had actually seen some success releasing content on FictionPress in my late teens or early twenties, but nothing really episodic. When I came back to it, I found it…annoying. Not in any objective way; in a ‘not for me’ way. Even so, I know I can’t rag on a site that’s doing pretty good things without any explanation, so let me start by saying a lot of nice things.</p>
<p>I think FictionPress is a good choice for a lot of people. Particularly, if you don’t have either a lot of time to figure out your own blog-like thing, or you like the idea of an in-built audience (even if you’ll still need to fight for it). This is also true of AO3 and FF.net to, to a greater or lesser extent. You create a profile, there’s light social media elements, and you can leave comments and reviews on stories, or post your own.</p>
<p>They all look fairly similar, which makes sense: FF.net and FP.com were made by the same people, and AO3 seems to be a more modern take on the same concept. I’m not sure if AO3 was inspired directly or indirectly by the other two, in form or function, but they do wind up giving fairly similar vibes and user experiences.</p>
<p>Here’s some screen grabs. I blurred the text so as to not repost the writing itself without permission.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9JRVbfW.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HVbfAuh.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WxyKeG8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m absolutely <strong>not</strong> criticizing these sites for having similar sorts of functionality and UIs. It works well, and reinventing the wheel is for idiots (like me). Instead, what I think bothers me about these sites is that they <em>feel</em> like they miss the point for what I want. In the first place, I want my control over the theming of my story. In particular, I prefer a minimalist design when reading (think <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>), but I also want to be able to adjust what I don’t like about whatever pre-baked theme pops out of some web designer’s brain. Blogging and site-builder software typically gives users this ability.</p>
<p>The second thing is that I’m not really interested in the social aspect, or at least this implementation of it. While there are dedicated readers and writers on these platforms, a lot of engagement comes from “trading” reads and comments. You comment me, I comment you. It’s a fine system, and I don’t mind critiquing others’ work or reading it. In fact I enjoy it. But I want people to read my work for the same reason I read theirs; because they want to. Now, any platform can have those gross tit-for-tat undertones, and networking is good in itself, even if you have to engage in a bit of that. But I feel like I could network in a deeper pool on Twitter and write content on my own platform without having to balance that smaller (though more effective short-term) social network baked into the fiction platform.</p>
<p>One service I didn’t mention is <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WattPad</a>. I think WattPad solves some of the problems of these other sites–particularly, I like the design, the layout, the functionality, and the general reading experience. But it’s social networking aspect is way, way, way more intense. From my own experience and the experience of other authors I’ve talked to, people on WattPad almost never just happen upon your story–you’ve got to go out and network until you’re sick of it, and then network some more, and probably a little more. And then the views will trickle in. It’s honestly a waste of time. It’s possible to make it there, and I’m sure some people have had good experiences; hell the front page shows some who must have. But the time investment for it seems out of whack to me. Whichever group of people wound up writing on WattPad seem to be way more interested in writing than reading, way more so than the other platforms. I can’t really recommend it. Again, I have a small sample size, so who knows? You may have a good experience. But I think the other sites here are better in terms of getting your content into people’s eyes.</p>
<h2 id="Serious-Begins"><a href="#Serious-Begins" class="headerlink" title="Serious Begins"></a>Serious Begins</h2><p>I’ve experimented, to a greater or lesser extent, with all of these platforms over the last decade or so. I don’t really <em>dislike</em> any of them. But as I learned more about web development and similar, I started to wonder, could I create a “blogging” engine for web serials? I knew, thanks to my time experimenting with <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a> (which powers this blog), that such a thing was possible. And my time working with Twine prepared me to understand how exactly a rendering system in a single page web app could be put together.</p>
<p>To start out, the goals of the Serious project were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories should be separated into episodes. Users should be able to easily see an index of episodes, a list of the most recent episodes, and jump quickly to the first or last episode.  </li>
<li>Each episode should have comments and the comment thread for each episode should be unique.  </li>
<li>The generated web app should be simple, easy to read, and require no meaningful input from the author, outside of configuration options.  </li>
<li>The generated web app should support, at the very least, CSS themes.  </li>
<li>The author should write their posts in markdown, allowing simple formatting, embedded images, links, and other HTML features with a low barrier to entry for non-programmers.  </li>
<li>Installing and using Serious should be as simple as possible.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing I needed to do was create an framework that accepted a configuration file and a series of markdown files, and covert those, along with an HTML template, into an app and all the required data. I wrote a script that created an HTML file from a template and a config file, and then created a simple file handler that turned a directory of markdown files into a series of JSON files.</p>
<p>The second stage of development was the most fun for me; generating the web app. I started with <a href="https://marked.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked.js</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jQuery</a>, and <a href="https://purecss.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure.css</a> as a jumping-off point and wrote Serious’s renderer from there. The renderer parses the URL and determines what exactly it needs to render based on that information; an episode, a <em>meta</em> post, or some sort of episode list (recent episodes in reverse order or the whole episode list in order). In addition to this, I wrote quick sidebar links to take the user to the first episode, the latest episode, the episode list, or the recent episodes list.</p>
<p>Adding <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disqus comments</a> wound up being incredibly simple, though at first I made the mistake of assuming it would be complicated in a single page app. Disqus is awesome, and this turned out to be a totally painless process. Implementing <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> was also a snap. After the rendering engine was complete, I hosted it on the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome jsDelivr CDN</a> to be served to the generated Serious apps.</p>
<p>The next part did prove a challenge, as I’ve never actually made an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPM</a> package before. I had to publish several versions in a row to get things working right, but I learned a lot. I’ve worked with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node</a> enough by now that the errors immediately made sense to me, but each error was hiding another, more critical error behind it. After releasing several versions in a row, I managed to get a stable working version out the door.</p>
<p>The NPM package is a CLI (command-line interface) app called <code>serious</code>. You need Nodejs to use it, but installing it is as simple as typing <code>npm install -g serious-fiction</code> into the console. This gives you access to the CLI; <code>cd</code> over to an empty folder and type in <code>serious init</code> to get started! If you’re interested, <a href="https://twinelab.net/serious">learn more here</a>.</p>
<p>I also wrote up a <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/serious-themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple themes for Serious</a>, and more are on the way. There aren’t any releases yet, but you can still grab the appropriate <code>theme.css</code> file to use one if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="Is-Serious-Right-for-Me"><a href="#Is-Serious-Right-for-Me" class="headerlink" title="Is Serious Right for Me?"></a>Is Serious Right for Me?</h2><p>Serious is probably not a perfect solution for every author, as it will require some know-how or some willingness to learn to actually put it into use for you. For the sake of clarity about <strong>who</strong> I envision this software is for, here’s a quick run down.</p>
<p><strong>Assuming you’re new to web development, are you willing to learn some programming?</strong></p>
<p>Serious is not meant to be advanced, or complicated, but it does use a lot of programming tools that most professional web developers use to make websites. These tools are built to be fast, effective, and efficient, not easy to use. If you can learn to set the clock on a VCR, you can learn this stuff, but it does take time and willingness. It can be rewarding though, and Serious may be a good way to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking specifically for a tool to help you make episodic content?</strong></p>
<p>Serious does <em>one</em> thing. It is not for blogs, personal web sites, portfolios, or press kits. There are probably some interesting use-cases for Serious that I haven’t thought of, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure you wouldn’t be better served by another platform?</strong></p>
<p>Websites like <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.fictionpress.com/</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://archiveofourown.org/</a>, mentioned above, allow authors to make episodic content, too. You should choose Serious instead if you want to create your own site and host it–you don’t want to be boxed into someone else’s platform, or if the concept of building it yourself seems interesting.</p>
<h2 id="Help"><a href="#Help" class="headerlink" title="Help!"></a>Help!</h2><p>In the near-ish future, I will be writing a complete “author’s” guide to using Serious. This guide will be written specifically for authors who have no experience with programming or the command line. It will cover everything from getting started with Nodejs to writing markdown to deploying your site on GitHub or NeoCities for free, and also a bit about setting up a custom domain.</p>
<p>This will not be a quick write, so if you’re interested in the software but just can’t figure out exactly how to <em>use</em> it, I hope to have something to help soon.</p>
<h2 id="The-Future-of-Serious"><a href="#The-Future-of-Serious" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Serious"></a>The Future of Serious</h2><p>There’s a few other things I have in the pipeline for Serious. Some of these may not come to fruition, but I hope to get at least some out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would live to try to build an editor for Serious, basically a GUI application that has a rich text editor and compiles your Serious story for you. This is not a small undertaking, and I’d need to make sure the main project is stable and reliable before breaking ground on something like this.  </li>
<li>A standalone executable will some someday. It will still be a command-line application, but it will come with an installer to set everything up for you and you won’t need Node, though Node with it’s ease of updating will always be the ideal way to use Serious. This will <em>definitely</em> happen, at least for Windows machines, but it will happen <em>after</em> the project stabilizes.  </li>
<li>More themes are in the pipeline. I feel like we have a few bases covered already, but I’d like to get a few more out there.  </li>
<li>Swappable templates for the html of the app is a long-term goal, but isn’t currently being worked on. This will allow <em>way</em> bigger UI changes than a theme will allow, and also allow the web app to load it’s scripts locally so authors can edit the rendering engine. Again, this is a long-term goal, no ETA.  </li>
<li>I think the ability to run custom scripts in the app similar to the way the themes work isn’t a terrible idea. I would need to wait for the project to fully stabilize and have a reliable API, and I’d need to write API docs though. Whether this happens or not will probably be based on if it’s requested. It’s possible, but not low-hanging fruit.</li>
</ul>

<li>Three shiny new macros have arrived in <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my custom macro collection for Twine/SugarCube 2</a>.  </li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/tweego-installer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweego installer</a> will be leaving active development soon and seeing full release. After it enters maintenance mode, I’ll largely just keep it’s story formats and Tweego binaries up to date, and fix any bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has already been a busy year for me! Once Serious stabilizes, I’ll probably take a break from my open source projects to get back to creating my own things, particularly my games. I also plan to start a web serial, but it may not be released under the “Chapel” pseudonym. Of course, seeing someone using Serious may tip you off if no one else likes the app, so we’ll see.</p>

        <p>They grow up so fast. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the notes for the last release, I’ve moved poof’s distribution to a CDN to avoid using the bandwidth from my personal site to host it. This has made the URL a little less sexy. For now, I’ve kept the old URL functional, but in a few weeks I’ll deactivate it, so be ready for that. </p>
<p>This release is a bit boring, as there’s no real changes anywhere, other than a migration to Gulp v4 to get rid of an annoying security warning from NPM. </p>
<p>Other than that, the move, and the version bump, this is poof 0.5.1 in every other way. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Poof is going into maintenance mode for the foreseeable future, so expect mostly bug fixes and boring releases for a while, with little in the way of new features or excitement. </p>
