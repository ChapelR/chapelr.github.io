    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.2.0 is here (already). This version ties up some loose ends in the re-implemented PDF export feature.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you’re having trouble with updating, grab the new link from the <a href="https://poof.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poof documentation</a>. I’ve updated the link there to always, always grab the latest stable version.</p>
<p>You now have options (configurable by the <code>poof.config</code> special passage) to control some basic styles of the generated PDF. First, you can select from one of three basic fonts: a serif option (Georgia), a sans-serif option (Roboto), and a monospace option (Consolas). Because the PDF export process requires fonts to be loaded as base-64 data into a “virtual file system”, the best I can do is provide basic options. Having three inoffensive options from the main font categories seemed like the wisest choice. Users can now also specify font sizes, the options are <code>very small</code>, <code>small</code>, <code>normal</code>, <code>large</code>, and <code>very large</code>. Normal is 12-point, very small is 8-point and very large is 16-point. The final option given is one for line height (or line spacing, if you prefer). You can set this option to a value between <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, with <code>1</code> being single-spaced and <code>2</code> being double-spaced. The defaul line height is <code>1.15</code>.</p>
<p>The style options provided above are all the low-hanging fruit I could manage. Since the new implementation generates a PDF on the fly from the HTML data, rather than generating a canvas image from the same, the styling options are fairly limited; it’s not as simple as recreating what appears on the screen anymore. In other words, we lost line numbers but gained copy/paste. And I’m alright with that. The simpler structure should be nicer for printers anyway. As always, though, if you want more, let me know and I’ll see if it’s at least possible.</p>
<p>In addition, a the loading screen is now called when a PDF generates. For short projects, you’ll see nothing at all, maybe a flash. For lengthier projects, the process can take several seconds or more, and messing with the filtering or sorting during this process is probably unwise, so I decided to lock out the screen completely instead of risking that happening. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen or so seconds to generate the PDF, even in novel-length projects, but the speed of the operation will vary from machine to machine and browser to browser. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Poof is going back on my maintenance shelf for now. I’m pleased with the new PDF implementation as it’s been a net positive all across the format, and getting the Twee encoder to respect filter and sort was something I was happy to knock out along the way. But other than those things, I don’t think there’s much more that needs to be done here.</p>
<p>I’ll be on the lookout for bugs, problems, and feature requests, as always.</p>
<h2 id="In-a-future-version-made-by-someone-smarter-than-me"><a href="#In-a-future-version-made-by-someone-smarter-than-me" class="headerlink" title="In a future version made by someone smarter than me:"></a>In a future version made by someone smarter than me:</h2><p>I jest, but I’ve been asked about implementing a “play order” sorting method. While this is theoretically possible, the only real way to do it would be to load up the story format engine in question, crawl the file somehow, and then interpret that order in a way that could be meaningfully sorted. I’m open to ideas, but I don’t believe this is possible–even parsing just the markup links in each passage to construct a rough order would be expensive performance-wise and time-consuming to implement. Not to mention that it wouldn’t really return a reliable play order. It’s an interesting problem, but I can’t think of a solution, outside using passage naming conventions, like numbers, in the first place.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.1.0 is now out. To use the new version, simply reinstall it from the CDN, or download the file from the same. </p>
<p>This version makes only a few critical but small changes to some of the export options. </p>
<p>First, the PDF export has been simplified. It now requires an Internet connection on first use to cache the scripts used, but the format file has been made significantly smaller (from ~580KB down to ~170KB) Additionally, the PDF export will now no longer generate a blank file on large stories. </p>
<p>The Twee exporter has also been rewritten to respect sort and filter options, so the resulting Twee file is now representive of what’s on screen, not what’s in the data chunk. </p>
<p>The trade-off is that both of these export options now take longer and use more resources, but I believe the benefits largely outweigh the heftier performance. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>As always I’ll be monitoring for bugs and problems. I will probably add some styling options to <code>poof.config</code> for the PDF export, like fonts, font size, and maybe line height and spacing.</p>

        <p>Long live… meh. </p>
<p>Anyway, when I first started working on Holy Land, and in Twine, I ran my related web presence through the aforementioned site, including my old blog. Since I’ve, shall we say, branched out, I decided to make this website, where I can park <em>all</em> my Twine and coding related stuff. </p>
<p>The only thing that hasn’t transitioned over is my old blog. While its possible for me to get those old posts and put them here, I’ve instead decided to make them available via archives.twinelab.net for now. That link will forward you automatically to the old Holy Land Devlog Blogger site, if you’re interested. </p>
<p>This also means that some old links may stop working. They’ve been fixed on my site and around my GitHub repos, but there isn’t much I can do about elsewhere. </p>
<p>There’s a few major benefits to the changes over to twinelab.net, the new blogging software, and the cleaned up web site here, but that’s for another day. </p>
<p>That’s all I have to say for now; I just wanted to clear up any potential confusion. </p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’ve just released an alpha-ish version of <a href="http://twinelab.net/serious">Serious</a>, a project I’ve been working on for quite some time. Serious generates static websites from markdown, and there’s nothing really special about that, and that’s sort of the tale of Serious in general. It’s <em>specific</em> and narrow in scope. So let’s try to figure out why Serious exists, who it’s for, and whether I’ve wasted all of my time.</p>
<h2 id="Serial-Fiction"><a href="#Serial-Fiction" class="headerlink" title="Serial Fiction"></a>Serial Fiction</h2><p>I’ve been wanting to get into writing a web serial for literal years. Initially I planned to use Blogger, or some other online blogging software, but what immediately struck me about those platforms was just how annoying it was to present structured, ordered content, particularly in an earliest-to-latest fashion. The only real thing you could do was create a hand-edited page on the site that collected all the episodes, in order, as links. So no excerpts or pretty stuff. Even next and previous buttons didn’t really work so well. They were there, sure, but often lost in a sea of suggestions, tags, similar posts–even ads.</p>
<p>I never did write any serial fiction, and the idea kind of died off. It’s possible on a blogging platform, but you really are fighting the platform on this one. Not only are you getting a lot of things you don’t need, but the things you do need are kludges and amateurish link-lists.</p>
<h2 id="AO3-and-FictionPress"><a href="#AO3-and-FictionPress" class="headerlink" title="AO3 and FictionPress"></a>AO3 and FictionPress</h2><p>I sort of forgot about <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FictionPress</a> (and its big brother, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FanFiction.net</a>) at the time I was looking into doing a serial. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AO3 (Archive of Our Own)</a> wasn’t around yet; it’s a newer but very similar take on what the other two were doing. A few years later, maybe 2012-ish I wanted to try my hand at serial fiction again. I had actually seen some success releasing content on FictionPress in my late teens or early twenties, but nothing really episodic. When I came back to it, I found it…annoying. Not in any objective way; in a ‘not for me’ way. Even so, I know I can’t rag on a site that’s doing pretty good things without any explanation, so let me start by saying a lot of nice things.</p>
<p>I think FictionPress is a good choice for a lot of people. Particularly, if you don’t have either a lot of time to figure out your own blog-like thing, or you like the idea of an in-built audience (even if you’ll still need to fight for it). This is also true of AO3 and FF.net to, to a greater or lesser extent. You create a profile, there’s light social media elements, and you can leave comments and reviews on stories, or post your own.</p>
<p>They all look fairly similar, which makes sense: FF.net and FP.com were made by the same people, and AO3 seems to be a more modern take on the same concept. I’m not sure if AO3 was inspired directly or indirectly by the other two, in form or function, but they do wind up giving fairly similar vibes and user experiences.</p>
<p>Here’s some screen grabs. I blurred the text so as to not repost the writing itself without permission.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9JRVbfW.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HVbfAuh.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WxyKeG8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m absolutely <strong>not</strong> criticizing these sites for having similar sorts of functionality and UIs. It works well, and reinventing the wheel is for idiots (like me). Instead, what I think bothers me about these sites is that they <em>feel</em> like they miss the point for what I want. In the first place, I want my control over the theming of my story. In particular, I prefer a minimalist design when reading (think <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>), but I also want to be able to adjust what I don’t like about whatever pre-baked theme pops out of some web designer’s brain. Blogging and site-builder software typically gives users this ability.</p>
<p>The second thing is that I’m not really interested in the social aspect, or at least this implementation of it. While there are dedicated readers and writers on these platforms, a lot of engagement comes from “trading” reads and comments. You comment me, I comment you. It’s a fine system, and I don’t mind critiquing others’ work or reading it. In fact I enjoy it. But I want people to read my work for the same reason I read theirs; because they want to. Now, any platform can have those gross tit-for-tat undertones, and networking is good in itself, even if you have to engage in a bit of that. But I feel like I could network in a deeper pool on Twitter and write content on my own platform without having to balance that smaller (though more effective short-term) social network baked into the fiction platform.</p>
<p>One service I didn’t mention is <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WattPad</a>. I think WattPad solves some of the problems of these other sites–particularly, I like the design, the layout, the functionality, and the general reading experience. But it’s social networking aspect is way, way, way more intense. From my own experience and the experience of other authors I’ve talked to, people on WattPad almost never just happen upon your story–you’ve got to go out and network until you’re sick of it, and then network some more, and probably a little more. And then the views will trickle in. It’s honestly a waste of time. It’s possible to make it there, and I’m sure some people have had good experiences; hell the front page shows some who must have. But the time investment for it seems out of whack to me. Whichever group of people wound up writing on WattPad seem to be way more interested in writing than reading, way more so than the other platforms. I can’t really recommend it. Again, I have a small sample size, so who knows? You may have a good experience. But I think the other sites here are better in terms of getting your content into people’s eyes.</p>
<h2 id="Serious-Begins"><a href="#Serious-Begins" class="headerlink" title="Serious Begins"></a>Serious Begins</h2><p>I’ve experimented, to a greater or lesser extent, with all of these platforms over the last decade or so. I don’t really <em>dislike</em> any of them. But as I learned more about web development and similar, I started to wonder, could I create a “blogging” engine for web serials? I knew, thanks to my time experimenting with <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a> (which powers this blog), that such a thing was possible. And my time working with Twine prepared me to understand how exactly a rendering system in a single page web app could be put together.</p>
<p>To start out, the goals of the Serious project were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories should be separated into episodes. Users should be able to easily see an index of episodes, a list of the most recent episodes, and jump quickly to the first or last episode.  </li>
<li>Each episode should have comments and the comment thread for each episode should be unique.  </li>
<li>The generated web app should be simple, easy to read, and require no meaningful input from the author, outside of configuration options.  </li>
<li>The generated web app should support, at the very least, CSS themes.  </li>
<li>The author should write their posts in markdown, allowing simple formatting, embedded images, links, and other HTML features with a low barrier to entry for non-programmers.  </li>
<li>Installing and using Serious should be as simple as possible.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing I needed to do was create an framework that accepted a configuration file and a series of markdown files, and covert those, along with an HTML template, into an app and all the required data. I wrote a script that created an HTML file from a template and a config file, and then created a simple file handler that turned a directory of markdown files into a series of JSON files.</p>
<p>The second stage of development was the most fun for me; generating the web app. I started with <a href="https://marked.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked.js</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jQuery</a>, and <a href="https://purecss.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure.css</a> as a jumping-off point and wrote Serious’s renderer from there. The renderer parses the URL and determines what exactly it needs to render based on that information; an episode, a <em>meta</em> post, or some sort of episode list (recent episodes in reverse order or the whole episode list in order). In addition to this, I wrote quick sidebar links to take the user to the first episode, the latest episode, the episode list, or the recent episodes list.</p>
<p>Adding <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disqus comments</a> wound up being incredibly simple, though at first I made the mistake of assuming it would be complicated in a single page app. Disqus is awesome, and this turned out to be a totally painless process. Implementing <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> was also a snap. After the rendering engine was complete, I hosted it on the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome jsDelivr CDN</a> to be served to the generated Serious apps.</p>
<p>The next part did prove a challenge, as I’ve never actually made an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPM</a> package before. I had to publish several versions in a row to get things working right, but I learned a lot. I’ve worked with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node</a> enough by now that the errors immediately made sense to me, but each error was hiding another, more critical error behind it. After releasing several versions in a row, I managed to get a stable working version out the door.</p>
<p>The NPM package is a CLI (command-line interface) app called <code>serious</code>. You need Nodejs to use it, but installing it is as simple as typing <code>npm install -g serious-fiction</code> into the console. This gives you access to the CLI; <code>cd</code> over to an empty folder and type in <code>serious init</code> to get started! If you’re interested, <a href="https://twinelab.net/serious">learn more here</a>.</p>
<p>I also wrote up a <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/serious-themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple themes for Serious</a>, and more are on the way. There aren’t any releases yet, but you can still grab the appropriate <code>theme.css</code> file to use one if you want to.</p>
<h2 id="Is-Serious-Right-for-Me"><a href="#Is-Serious-Right-for-Me" class="headerlink" title="Is Serious Right for Me?"></a>Is Serious Right for Me?</h2><p>Serious is probably not a perfect solution for every author, as it will require some know-how or some willingness to learn to actually put it into use for you. For the sake of clarity about <strong>who</strong> I envision this software is for, here’s a quick run down.</p>
<p><strong>Assuming you’re new to web development, are you willing to learn some programming?</strong></p>
<p>Serious is not meant to be advanced, or complicated, but it does use a lot of programming tools that most professional web developers use to make websites. These tools are built to be fast, effective, and efficient, not easy to use. If you can learn to set the clock on a VCR, you can learn this stuff, but it does take time and willingness. It can be rewarding though, and Serious may be a good way to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking specifically for a tool to help you make episodic content?</strong></p>
<p>Serious does <em>one</em> thing. It is not for blogs, personal web sites, portfolios, or press kits. There are probably some interesting use-cases for Serious that I haven’t thought of, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure you wouldn’t be better served by another platform?</strong></p>
<p>Websites like <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.fictionpress.com/</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://archiveofourown.org/</a>, mentioned above, allow authors to make episodic content, too. You should choose Serious instead if you want to create your own site and host it–you don’t want to be boxed into someone else’s platform, or if the concept of building it yourself seems interesting.</p>
<h2 id="Help"><a href="#Help" class="headerlink" title="Help!"></a>Help!</h2><p>In the near-ish future, I will be writing a complete “author’s” guide to using Serious. This guide will be written specifically for authors who have no experience with programming or the command line. It will cover everything from getting started with Nodejs to writing markdown to deploying your site on GitHub or NeoCities for free, and also a bit about setting up a custom domain.</p>
<p>This will not be a quick write, so if you’re interested in the software but just can’t figure out exactly how to <em>use</em> it, I hope to have something to help soon.</p>
<h2 id="The-Future-of-Serious"><a href="#The-Future-of-Serious" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Serious"></a>The Future of Serious</h2><p>There’s a few other things I have in the pipeline for Serious. Some of these may not come to fruition, but I hope to get at least some out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would live to try to build an editor for Serious, basically a GUI application that has a rich text editor and compiles your Serious story for you. This is not a small undertaking, and I’d need to make sure the main project is stable and reliable before breaking ground on something like this.  </li>
<li>A standalone executable will some someday. It will still be a command-line application, but it will come with an installer to set everything up for you and you won’t need Node, though Node with it’s ease of updating will always be the ideal way to use Serious. This will <em>definitely</em> happen, at least for Windows machines, but it will happen <em>after</em> the project stabilizes.  </li>
<li>More themes are in the pipeline. I feel like we have a few bases covered already, but I’d like to get a few more out there.  </li>
<li>Swappable templates for the html of the app is a long-term goal, but isn’t currently being worked on. This will allow <em>way</em> bigger UI changes than a theme will allow, and also allow the web app to load it’s scripts locally so authors can edit the rendering engine. Again, this is a long-term goal, no ETA.  </li>
<li>I think the ability to run custom scripts in the app similar to the way the themes work isn’t a terrible idea. I would need to wait for the project to fully stabilize and have a reliable API, and I’d need to write API docs though. Whether this happens or not will probably be based on if it’s requested. It’s possible, but not low-hanging fruit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="In-Other-News"><a href="#In-Other-News" class="headerlink" title="In Other News"></a>In Other News</h2><p>Some other news from my world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three shiny new macros have arrived in <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my custom macro collection for Twine/SugarCube 2</a>.  </li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/tweego-installer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweego installer</a> will be leaving active development soon and seeing full release. After it enters maintenance mode, I’ll largely just keep it’s story formats and Tweego binaries up to date, and fix any bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has already been a busy year for me! Once Serious stabilizes, I’ll probably take a break from my open source projects to get back to creating my own things, particularly my games. I also plan to start a web serial, but it may not be released under the “Chapel” pseudonym. Of course, seeing someone using Serious may tip you off if no one else likes the app, so we’ll see.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the notes for the last release, I’ve moved poof’s distribution to a CDN to avoid using the bandwidth from my personal site to host it. This has made the URL a little less sexy.

<p>This release is a bit boring, as there’s no real changes anywhere, other than a migration to Gulp v4 to get rid of an annoying security warning from NPM. </p>

<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Poof is going into maintenance mode for the foreseeable future, so expect mostly bug fixes and boring releases for a while, with little in the way of new features or excitement. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>It’s finally time to talk about <em>Holy Land</em> again. The game feels like it’s been in development hell, almost, a weird issue for a personal project. The issues facing its development have to some extent been author-imposed, but to a greater extent were a result of my inexperience as a developer, and the soul-crushing realization that the game needed a page-one (byte-one?) rewrite.</p>
<p>But that rewrite has been going on for a year (though not full-time, as I’ve been working on other smaller projects and <em>Deep Dive</em>) and the project has finally started to take shape. This is the first time I’ve been able to actually <em>play</em> the new version of the game, and it was a rewarding step, and one that’s left me wanting to discuss it.</p>
<p>Before we get into that, though, a caveat: <em>Holy Land</em> is a ways off. As I’ve transitioned from development of <em>Deep Dive</em> to content writing, I’ve spent more and more time on development for <em>Holy Land</em>, but that development work is not all that close to completion. It will still probably come out sometime after <em>Deep Dive</em>, and I’m not attaching a release date or window to that project yet. But I do have a few things I want to share with you about the nature of the new version of <em>Holy Land</em>. First, though, let’s talk about that rewrite.</p>
<h2 id="Spaghetti"><a href="#Spaghetti" class="headerlink" title="Spaghetti"></a>Spaghetti</h2><p><em>Holy Land</em> (the original version) started development in early November 2016, in Twine 1, SugarCube 2. At that time I was a novice with Twine, web development, knew no JavaScript, and was generally ill-equipped to program a game of this complexity. While the game and its systems obviously worked, they were poorly implemented. The biggest issue was my own growth. I became a way better programmer as I went, and trying to socket better code onto a rickety code base was quickly becoming a mess. Essentially, this version of the game became playable <em>very</em> quickly; as early as late December, the game’s combat systems and UI were usable, and a prototype was released in late January. I don’t want to undersell the prototype, because I think it was impressive from the end-user side. From the development side, though, I might as well have been using line numbers.</p>
<p>As I bolted more and more code onto it, the game started to buckle under its own weight. It became a sunk-cost fallacy for me. The game <em>worked</em> even if updating something as simple as the length of status effects took ten lines of code across various passages, widgets, and story files. I was constantly convincing myself that the finish line was the most important thing–no one would care that the code was garbage. Of course no one would care, so I was half right. But adding newer, better written features (my custom macro set first entered the world as a series of subsystems for <em>Holy Land</em>) became a chore–I’d have to remember where to go and what to change every time I improved something.</p>
<p>It was when Tweego 1.0.0 (or so) released and I started messing with the program that I realized I wanted to move development to Tweego. Twine 1 has issues compiling large stories, and while I managed to work around some of them, by this point the writing was on the wall. Exporting the Twine 1 files to Twee source confirmed what I knew all along, I couldn’t work with this project anymore. Seeing my source code laid bare in a text file reinforced the idea that the game had become an unworkable mess. I knew I had to rewrite the code, so I started by trying to pull out and separate the systems into self-enclosed modules that could be worked on independently. This became such a rat’s nest that I ultimately had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>In November 2017, development of this version of <em>Holy Land</em> completely ceased. I later grew concerned that no part of the game would <em>ever</em> release, and so I released a “second prototype” in March the next year. There were good concepts and ideas in the game, and I wanted to make sure something of its year-long development saw the light of day. By this point, I wasn’t concerned about a bad release “tarnishing my brand”, something I initially considered could be an issue when development stopped. I just wanted <em>something</em> of it to survive in case I became unable to restart it and get it to a proper release.</p>
<h2 id="Reinventing-the-Wheel"><a href="#Reinventing-the-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="Reinventing the Wheel"></a>Reinventing the Wheel</h2><p>I was still getting better pretty rapidly at programming, and it occurred to me that starting over immediately wasn’t an ideal use of my time. I threw myself into working on <em>Deep Dive</em>, a project I started for the Twine discord server’s game jam which rapidly grew into something large and unfit for that event, and continued answering questions across a variety of Twine communities, moderating many of those communities, and developing add-ons, tools, and other software for the community.</p>
<p>I conceived of a complete, bespoke “engine” for <em>Holy Land</em> in mid-2017, and started working on it on and off starting in late 2017 or early 2018. The idea was fairly simple. The game needed every system to be a complete, self-contained module that could be imported into a generic “template” that would hold these systems together and bind them to data that held all the game’s characters, enemies, gear, spells, etc. This would also allow me to release <em>Holy Land</em> as an episodic game (my file system macro set is designed to allow save-importing across episodes, and was created for this engine). I call it the HLE (<em>Holy Land</em> Engine, yes I’m not all that creative when I don’t have to be).</p>
<p>For the interested, the engine contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fractal/Fracas</strong>: This is the game’s combat implementation. If any part of the engine is ever released for other authors to use, this will be it.  </li>
<li><strong>Pressure</strong>: Named for my old SugarCube stylesheet set, this is a library of UI components for the game.  </li>
<li><strong>CharacterCore</strong>: This system takes raw character data and creates SugarCube serialize-able/save-able custom objects with all sorts of goodies.  </li>
<li><strong>Noteworthy</strong>: A side-quest and journal implementation.  </li>
<li><strong>Quartermaster</strong>: An equipment system.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these major systems, a number of smaller systems also deserve some mention: a traits system, use-based leveling that compliments experience-based leveling, a personality system for the protagonist that allows them to subtly change in reaction to player choices, and even some surprises I’ll keep close to my chest for now.</p>
<p>In short, the HLE is in a good place. The second version of the game itself doesn’t really exist as such, and I plan to take my time with it. But having an “engine,” though incomplete, that is able to spit out functional, fun (if I do say so myself) combat encounters really, really got me excited to spend more time on this game. These small-ish victories are all that keeps creators going when undertaking massive, long-term projects like this.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-New"><a href="#What’s-New" class="headerlink" title="What’s New?"></a>What’s New?</h2><p>The second version of the game is very similar to the first, but with a few things simplified and a few others expanded. Something I’ve always wanted to achieve is a sort of load-out-based RPG, where builds and gear are the focus over moment-to-moment strategy. Still, I think the combat in the original version didn’t have enough flair. For this reason, I decided to add a few new bells and whistles. Chief among these is cast-able spells with a cooldown system, a revamped attack system (no more mashing, combos are still possible but work a bit differently) and more dangerous enemies that have more abilities in common with players.</p>
<p>While I’m excited to share more, it’s hard to really explain something like this without letting you play it, and I’d prefer to let the game speak for itself someday through a prototype. The biggest change, though, I think, is the episodic structure. <em>Holy Land</em> will release in chapters now rather than as a single lengthy experience. I also may try to monetize the game in some way, though I haven’t made decisions regarding that quite yet. It won’t be ads, though.</p>
<h2 id="Yet-a-Ways-Off"><a href="#Yet-a-Ways-Off" class="headerlink" title="Yet a Ways Off"></a>Yet a Ways Off</h2><p>Don’t expect <em>Holy Land</em> in any reasonable amount of time. At best you can expect some closed-beta prototyping on the Discord server, and maybe a bit of showing off via a short demo sometime next year. I can’t stress enough that this is more of a sharing my excitement sort of post than an announcement, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="Project-Round-Up"><a href="#Project-Round-Up" class="headerlink" title="Project Round Up"></a>Project Round Up</h2><p>The year is ending, so here’s the status of some of my other projects right now and what you can expect nest year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>poof</strong>: My comment-based proofing story format is close to a full release. Once it hits 1.0.0 in a few weeks, it’ll leave active development and enter maintenance until I have further ideas for it.  </li>
<li><strong>HAL</strong>: My Harlowe Audio Library is currently in maintenance. I’m happy with how it turned out, but I will admit that it isn’t seeing the amount of use I was expecting. Harlowe users seem to kind of hate it. I think it’s just scary in certain ways–it feels too JavaScript-y, perhaps, or like there’s just too much there and it’s too complicated, and even a metric ton of documentation doesn’t seem to help much. In short, those who have managed to use it seem to think it’s at least good enough to keep using, but many authors don’t seem to even try it. A second major version will attempt to address this someday, but for now, I think it’s like medicine: it’s good for you, but a spoonful of sugar could help.  </li>
<li><strong>Custom Macros</strong>: In spite of there being no reason to be rushing out versions of this macro set, I still feel like I’m eternally behind with it. Expect new macros, more guides, a better demo, and improved docs throughout next year.  </li>
<li><strong>Noble Avatars</strong>: <em>Sigh</em>. There’s lots of promise here, but I was hoping to get some additional assets for avatars to be able to really make this a thing. In my brain, I imagined Twine users who were good artists would be willing to provide more asset sets in a variety of styles, but it turns out that working for free isn’t a very tempting prospect. I don’t blame people for not wanting to do it, but it does sort of make dedicating my time to a dead-end project like this a hard sell. What’s here works, but I can’t justify finishing it and adding all the polish I wanted for it if there just isn’t much interest from artists in supporting it. And no, I can’t and won’t pay to generate art for an open-source project designed to help authors. I’ll pay for my own art, but that’s about it.  </li>
<li><strong>Howler for Harlowe</strong>: I will begrudgingly fix things when absolutely necessary.  </li>
<li><strong>Tweego Setup</strong>: I have a few updates planned for this repository, but it’s all small, and not very exciting stuff. Nothing that will dramatically change the way you use it or what it does, just a few fixes and some clean up.</li>
<li><strong>An Unreleased Project</strong>: I’m making another piece of software that is unrelated to Twine that I’ll probably talk about here. It’s for writers wanting to create a certain kind of web content, and I don’t expect it to be that big a deal, but it’s something I want for myself, so I may as well release it in case anyone else wants something similar.</li>
<li><strong>TwineLab</strong>: TwineLab.net itself will be going through a few changes next year too, and I’m considering adding Google analytics to it as well, though mostly to get used to using it rather than because I need the data. I’m also considering losing some of the ko-fi links I jammed everywhere, as it feels a bit tacky to me, and having those links everywhere has resoundingly <strong>not</strong> increased my income there (I am fortunate enough to not really need the money; I do all this Twine-stuff for fun on the side, so it’s not really a major issue, but I figured it’d be interesting to see what kind of support I could get, as people have asked about donating before). Something about asking for money for my projects here feels dirty to me anyhow, not exactly sure why, so I may end the ko-fi thing entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Happy-Holidays"><a href="#Happy-Holidays" class="headerlink" title="Happy Holidays"></a>Happy Holidays</h2><p>If you read this blog, thanks for doing so! I hope your holidays are wonderful. I’m getting all this stuff out and off my chest now because I don’t plan on doing much blogging until next year. I’ll no doubt have more things to discuss then.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof 0.5.0 is here, and poof is now considered feature-complete. </p>
<p>This update adds the following things: </p>
<p>Optional, toggle-able <a href="https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">line numbers</a> have been added to all source code output, including passage text, JavaScript, and CSS code. This setting is on by default, but can be toggled in the view menu or defaulted to being off in the <code>poof.config</code> special passage via the setting <code>&quot;lineNumbers&quot;</code>. Line numbers can appear in the PDF export based on this setting as well.</p>
<p>The linting feature for JavaScript now reports warnings, but has also been made “format aware”, so global story format variables are not warned about. This should help authors catch misspelled variable names and other issues. Your intended build format can be overridden via <code>poof.config</code>; this is particularly important for CLI compilers like Tweego. You can also greenlight an array of global variables for the linter.</p>
<p>The source code of the project has been refactored. The entire codebase is now faster, more efficient and less redundant. </p>
<p>The build process of the format is now cleaner, faster, and more user-friendly, meaning forks and rebuilds of poof are easier than ever. <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/poof/blob/master/docs/developer.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer documentation</a> has also been added. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-v0-5-x-builds"><a href="#In-future-v0-5-x-builds" class="headerlink" title="In future v0.5.x builds:"></a>In future v0.5.x builds:</h2><p>I will mostly be monitoring for bugs. Some clean-up and internal improvements will be made. </p>
<h2 id="In-later-versions"><a href="#In-later-versions" class="headerlink" title="In later versions:"></a>In later versions:</h2><p>Poof is feature complete to my specifications and desires. Feel free to make additional feature requests, though. God willing, the next version will be a stable v1.0.0 release. This rollout will probably see poof moved to a proper CDN, and only development versions will be hosted via TwineLab, to help save me some bandwidth on my personal site. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof 0.4.0 will add a few bells and whistles to your JavaScript and CSS views. </p>
<p>First, syntax highlighting powered by <a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlight.js</a> has been added to both views. Passage source code doesn’t (and likely won’t ever) get syntax highlighting, though. </p>
<p>Second, a shiny new “lint” button has been added to the JavaScript view. This button uses a client-side, CDN-hosted version of <a href="https://jshint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSHint</a> to help you debug your JavaScript code. It requires a web connection on at least the first use, though the script should cache itself for future offline usage. </p>
<p>This version also includes a critical bug fix for compatibility with <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweego</a>, which expects formats to be valid JSON, not just JavaScript (which is totally fair, mind you). Currently, the v0.3.x format files return a valid JavaScript object that is not valid JSON, which was unwise on my part and only implemented to save a few bytes. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-0-4-x-versions"><a href="#In-future-0-4-x-versions" class="headerlink" title="In future 0.4.x versions:"></a>In future 0.4.x versions:</h2><p>A few patches will be released over the next few days/weeks to make the linter story format-aware to prevent false positives with certain code. </p>
<p>As always, I intend to keep on top of any bugs or weirdness, too. </p>
<h2 id="In-later-versions"><a href="#In-later-versions" class="headerlink" title="In later versions:"></a>In later versions:</h2><p>Depending on the reaction to the linting feature, a similar CSS validation feature may arrive in a future version, though validating CSS in the client-side may prove enough of a challenge that it may get pushed off to a later version or abandoned. JavaScript linting is a much bigger deal anyway, in my opinion. </p>
<p>The PDF export option may get off-loaded to a CDN like the linter, meaning it will work as a cache-able script rather than being built in. This will massively reduce the size of poof, but may not be worth it based on how often this feature is used. </p>
<p>At some point in the future, poof will go through a mild refactor of its codebase and build process to make it easier to work with, particularly for other devs. This will happen sometime prior to the full 1.0.0 release. </p>
<p>I’m considering reworking the codebase to use node modules and webpack (or similar) as well, but such a refactor would increase the format’s size by a not insignificant margin, and only mildly help devs work on it, so I’m not convinced this is the right way to go. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I’m a writer by trade. While I dabble in Twine, programming, and web development, writing is my job and, largely, my passion. For me, Twine is an attractive platform for development not just because of its relative simplicity, but also because of its focus on writing and its output to supremely shareable HTML files. But I think that Twine also has a problem, or blind spot at least, when it comes to a good writing, editing, and rewriting workflow. It’s just not all that easy to iterate on your prose the same way you can iterate on your design, mechanics, and code. </p>
<p>Maybe I’ve been spoiled by technology, but I want to be able to draft, fix, update, and draft more. I want to be able to work on my prose and mark it up with a pen, away from the harsh blue light of my computer screen. I want to be able to write notes about changes I want to make in between editing sessions. I want to be able to share my drafts with my friends for feedback, and get their comments and corrections. </p>
<p>So I made a proofing format called <a href="https://twinelab.net/poof/">poof</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-Old-Ways"><a href="#The-Old-Ways" class="headerlink" title="The Old Ways"></a>The Old Ways</h2><p>I am involved pretty heavily in the Twine community, and most of the Twine authors I work with or help out know I’m a writer. They’re also often writers themselves. When I’m asked to critique one of their stories, they’re often looking for more than just impressions, and I want to give more, too. I want to be able to point to a sentence, word, phrase, and say, “hey, I tripped on this.” </p>
<p>What I typically do is hack the JavaScript a bit via the console to report to me the passage title on every new passage. It’s easier to do in SugarCube, but also possible in Harlowe. Then I open a Google doc, write the passage title in, copy and paste some problem text over, and make a comment in the Google doc, writing my thoughts there. </p>
<p>It’s laborious, boring. While in one sense it gives me a moment to think through my reaction, it also makes the process unappealing in general. </p>
<p>It was this dissatisfaction that first have rise to a desire for a proofing format designed to help me make my own critiquing / editing workflow simpler, faster, and more fun. Making a story format, though, isn’t really something you do in an evening, even for one as simple at its core as poof. But I assumed I could make one, if I was so inclined. Regardless, the idea, while there, wasn’t really formed. </p>
<h2 id="The-Problem-of-Paperthin"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Paperthin" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Paperthin"></a>The Problem of Paperthin</h2><p>Paperthin is a format with a clever name and almost nothing happening under the hood. And that’s not a bad thing, per se. The amount of complexity required from a proofing format is directly correlated to what you expect it to do. Paperthin’s job is to put your passage text together into a single doc for viewing. Nothing more or less. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the critical flaw of Paperthin is the unwise (in my opinion) use of CSS pseudo-elements, specifically, the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element. Paperthin renders each passage’s source code with a <code>::before</code> holding the passage title. In CSS, pseudo-elements are not considered to be part of the document proper. They’re intended to be used as embellishments, icons, etc; things that don’t contribute to the document’s meaning or formatting. When you copy/paste or print the document, these pseudo-elements are omitted. By using these <code>::before</code> pseudo-elements, Paperthin hamstrings its own usefulness. It becomes only a simple, readable copy that you can’t do anything else with. </p>
<p>So as an editing tool, importing a game into Twine a pulling up the proofing copy in Paperthin is less helpful overall than I feel it could be. And Paperthin has no JavaScript or commenting or editing, so as a format for critiquing or iterating on a draft, you’re just wasting time. It’s still easier to hack out the passage name in the console and use a Google doc for the heavy lifting. </p>
<h2 id="Decompiling-to-Twee"><a href="#Decompiling-to-Twee" class="headerlink" title="Decompiling to Twee"></a>Decompiling to Twee</h2><p>There are many ways, including utility formats and third party compilers, to get a story into Twee notation, a plain text format designed for viewing and editing in a text editor. This is a useful feature, and one that wound up being included in poof, but more on my format later. </p>
<p>Many text editors come with spellcheck and other tools that can help you iterate on your prose, but I also think that as a critiquing or editing solution, there are some faults here, the biggest of them being the slowness of implementation. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about the other side of a critique or editing pass for a moment, the part where the original author (who may also be you) goes through the editing notes and weighs and implements the changes. Your editor (who, again, may also be you) just sent you a text dump of your story. Whether they’ve edited directly in the source or added notes, you now need to find every change or suggestion, review it, and decide what to do with it. You’ve been given a haystack full of needles. </p>
<p>While the editing pass was easy, the actual iteration becomes a slog. If you’re doing your own editing, this is less a problem, but only slightly, and that also assumes that your editing pass consists of fixes, not notes, to-do lists, etc. Mine usually consist of both, and I doubt I’m alone in that. </p>
<p>Any effective editing solution requires two major components.  First, changes, notes, and edits must be easy to make; second, changes, notes, and edits must be easy to find, review, and implement.</p>
<h2 id="Yeah-Sure-but-Illume"><a href="#Yeah-Sure-but-Illume" class="headerlink" title="Yeah, Sure, but Illume"></a>Yeah, Sure, but Illume</h2><p>Illume is a proofing format that allows authors to export their edits and changes as diffs, and is frankly an incredible solution. Poof is not really intended to be a replacement for Illume, as what Illume does is pretty great.</p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar, you can use this link to install and check out Illume: <code>https://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/format.js</code>.</p>
<p>Illume allows you to edit passages using a built-in editor, flag them as reviewed, and move on. You can export HTML files with your diffs, and use these files as a guide to your reviewing and editing process. Like poof, Illume also allows for a great deal of export options, and has ignore tags.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to use Illume or poof will likely come down to preference. I have nothing but nice things to say about Illume, but I did develop poof anyhow, and for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think importable / exportable comments are a better solution for editing <em>another</em> author’s work. I think Illume is a superior format for iterating on your <em>own</em> prose, but I think being able to import comments from files makes it easier to work in larger teams, with more people, etc. This isn’t to say you <em>can’t</em> do this in Illume, only that I feel, personally, that being able to collect comments from multiple sources into a single poof view makes poof ideal for this specific use-case.  </li>
<li>I think poof offers a different (though not necessarily better) toolset. While you can organize, find, and, filter passages with Illume, the focus of Illume is overwhelmingly on moving each passage from the “needs reviewed” list to the “reviewed” list.  Poof has a similar filtering option; you can filter passages by whether they have comments or don’t, meaning after you’re done reviewing a passage, you can throw a comment on it that just says “done” or something, even if you don’t think the passage needs a change.  </li>
<li>In a similar vein to both of these, I think poof is just less <em>opinionated</em> than Illume. It makes fewer assumptions about how you want to edit, who you are in relation to the project you’re editing, and how you want to spend your editing time. This means that poof has some benefits for some people compared to Illume, but also pales in comparison in other areas. Being less opinionated means that poof is less specialized and more generic.</li>
</ol>
<p>What proofing format is right for you isn’t a call I can make, and while I think that Illume is incredible, I also designed poof because it more closely reflects my own desires and editing habits. If you edit like me–that it with notes and comments first, then rewrites, then more notes, then more rewrites, poof will probably fit your habits. If you prefer diving into edits right away, Illume will give you more bang for your buck. I think in either case, managing multiple comment sets is easier than managing multiple diff files, so I think if you’re working in a team, or sending your comments to another author, poof is worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="Iterating-on-Prose"><a href="#Iterating-on-Prose" class="headerlink" title="Iterating on Prose"></a>Iterating on Prose</h2><p>From this point on, we’re going to focus on poof, and some ways I think you can use it to help iterate on your prose. We’re not going to talk about Paperthin or Illume anymore; compare these proofing formats yourself and reach your own conclusions based on your needs.</p>
<p>Before we get too far ahead, let me clarify a term I’ve been using. They sound jargon-y, and I think I want to make sure we’re on the same page. So what do I mean by “iterating on your prose” anyway.</p>
<p>When I write, I waste no time concerning myself with quality on a first draft. To me, drafting is about words on a page, not perfection. It’s about the finish line, and generating something that can be refined later. Even if you don’t do this, your first draft will be garbage. It needs to be iterated on.</p>
<p>Iteration is the process of taking something, using it as a blueprint, and building something better with it. Your drafts are not your story, but a guide to what your story will ultimately become, through a process of editing, taking notes, and rewriting: iteration. Your prose will never be perfect. Instead, the process of iterating will become less effective until it is no longer worth the time.</p>
<p>This is how I approach writing, and how most of the writers I know do as well, though some to a lesser or greater extent. You don’t <em>need</em> to write like this to use poof or get something out of it, but I think it helps to understand my process to understand why poof is designed the way it is.</p>
<h2 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h2><p>In poof, comments are the primary way you’ll interact with your prose. You can click the pencil icon to create a comment that contains all the passage text of the indicated passage to make edits, or create a new comment to leave notes, ideas, and suggestions. These comments are portable, meaning you can create a bunch of comments, then export a comment file to share with another poof-using person. This person can then import your comments into their poof view, and your comments will be added to any comments that are already there. This means you can use comments from a variety of collaborators, editors, or friends and see them all in one view, and delete them as you address them.</p>
<p>You can filter out passages that have or don’t have comments to help keep you on track. You can also search through and sort passages by a variety of metrics, so you can easily be playing a Twine game in one window, and commenting up those passages in poof in another, without having to hack the game to find the passage title: just filter by passage text.</p>
<p>Comments aren’t a perfect solution to everything: sometimes you just need a diff view like one powered by Illume, so you can create and export your edits. But as a general use way of taking note, recording reactions, and suggesting changes or edits, comments work pretty well, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Features"><a href="#Other-Features" class="headerlink" title="Other Features"></a>Other Features</h2><p>Finding and commenting on passages is probably the best use of poof, but a number of other useful features are included.  Here’s a quick breakdown of what else you have at your fingertips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export to PDF format to print and share. PDF format renders a very shareable copy of your passage content, and one that won’t look crappy if you want a physical copy to mark up with a pen.  </li>
<li>Export to Twee notation. As mentioned, poof can export to Twee, so you don’t need to get a format or compiler just for that.  </li>
<li>Export a Twine archive. Twine’s archive option archives <em>all</em> of your stories. You can use this option to generate a much, much smaller archive to create a backup of youor work.  </li>
<li>View modes. Poof comes with a variety of viewing options, including a simplified mode, a night mode, and more, all designed to help you get comfy and settle in for some reading.  </li>
<li>You can use a special passage to configure poof’s default settings, fonts, etc, and can tag certain passages to be ignores by poof.  </li>
<li>You can also view your JavaScript and CSS code with poof.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-Poof-Powered-Editing-Workflow"><a href="#A-Poof-Powered-Editing-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="A Poof-Powered Editing Workflow"></a>A Poof-Powered Editing Workflow</h2><p>As a sort of sign-off, here’s some ideas I had while building poof. When you develop anything as complex as this, it helps to think about what you want and expect users to do with it. As I worked on poof, I thought about how I would want to use it, and how it could be used. Here’s a few examples of how you might build an editing or critiquing workflow using poof based on those design ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> </p>
<p>You’re playing a game a fellow Twine author asked you to critique, and as you go you have comments, suggestions, and ideas. You import the game into your preferred compiler and open it in poof. As you play, you search for and find the passages you want with poof’s finding and filtering tools and make comments, then export the comment file and send it to the author.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> </p>
<p>You’re making a game with another dev, either as an editor or sharing the writing load, and need a quick way to share ideas and comments. You can “trade” comment files to see each other’s thoughts and make plans. While this is really no alternative to version control, opening issues on a repo is nowhere near as effective as a means for sharing writing ideas. </p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<p>You want your non-Twine-using friend to give you feedback on your writing for a Twine game. Assuming they sufficiently understand the concepts of CYOA-style IF and passages, you could create a PDF export and send it to them. They can then import this file into Google Drive and create comments, or print it and mark it up.</p>
<h2 id="The-Future"><a href="#The-Future" class="headerlink" title="The Future"></a>The Future</h2><p>Poof is still in a pre-release state, currently at version 0.3.2. This means poof isn’t done by a long shot. I considered adding diffs similar to Illume, but there’s little chance such an addition will ever be as fully-featured and well-designed as Illume: it will always be an after-thought at this point. While poof is <em>largely</em> feature-complete, there’s still a few bells and whistles and adjustments to be made, and if there’s something you want to see in a future version, <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/poof/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise an issue at the repo</a>.</p>
<p>Note that poof isn’t going to do a complete 180 at this point. Future development on poof is unlikely to change the direction of the project, so if you’re not a fan or prefer another proofing format, there’s a pretty low chance that poof is going to set your world on fire in a later version. But I am open to hearing what you think it could do better anyhow, if you’ve got the time to talk.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty pleased with how this project turned out, but there’s a lot of room for improvement, especially internally. Now that version 0.3.2 is up and most major bugs have been fixed and patched, I’ll probably be taking a week or two off before diving into the 0.4.0 verison, though I will certainly patch bugs if needed.</p>
