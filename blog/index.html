    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This release includes two new systems, one bug fix, and some documentation and website fixes.</p>
<h3 id="The-Continue-lt-lt-cont-gt-gt-Macro"><a href="#The-Continue-lt-lt-cont-gt-gt-Macro" class="headerlink" title="The Continue &lt;&lt;cont&gt;&gt; Macro"></a>The Continue <code>&lt;&lt;cont&gt;&gt;</code> Macro</h3><p>A thing I see requested reasonably often is a “click anywhere to continue” style of macro. In fact I’ve written a few implementations for people in the past, but was never super happy with any of them. Well, I’m not super happy with this one either, it’s significantly clunkier to use than I think it should be, but it’s the best implementation I’m personally likely to develop, and it’s not bad, just probably not as slick as you may expect.</p>
<p>You can optionally make pressing any key also activate the macro, and adjust other options.</p>
<h3 id="The-Speech-Box-System"><a href="#The-Speech-Box-System" class="headerlink" title="The Speech Box System"></a>The Speech Box System</h3><p>I sometimes call things a “macro” even when they have some JavaScript functions or interfaces built-in, as long as there’s just one macro in the script and that’s the primary interface most users will utilize. I often call things “macro sets” when there’s a few related macros involved. I use the term “system” when I’m not really sure what the hell to call something. This is one of those latter things, because what it actually does is give you a “macro factory” that creates macros at runtime. You plug a name and image URL into the <code>&lt;&lt;character&gt;&gt;</code> macro and it creates a shiny new macro you can use based on the supplied name for character speech / dialog<strong>ue</strong> boxes (I avoid the term “dialogue” in favor of “speech” in the documentation and elsewhere for fear of confusion with the unrelated term “dialog”, which refers to a modal box, like an alert or prompt or similar). </p>
<p>Here’s an image of what I mean by a “speech box:”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CkI3K8Q.png" alt="Speech box example"></p>
<p>It’s intentionally basic and bare bones. Whip up some CSS and make it your own! The minimalist look can probably work fine for games that use the basic SugarCube look, though, so I wouldn’t sweat it too much if CSS isn’t your thing.</p>
<p>(Note: This Lisa is apparently a K-Pop star. She’s basically the first page of results on Google image search. I picked the first square image I could see and basically used it in several examples. I do <em>not</em> own this image, but I believe this counts as having changed it significantly enough to count as fair use, and should be defensible as fair use given the educational nature of my documentation and examples. In other words, don’t @ me.)</p>
<h3 id="Bug-Fix-in-lt-lt-notify-gt-gt"><a href="#Bug-Fix-in-lt-lt-notify-gt-gt" class="headerlink" title="Bug Fix in &lt;&lt;notify&gt;&gt;"></a>Bug Fix in <code>&lt;&lt;notify&gt;&gt;</code></h3><p>Somehow missed this one. I did test it, but I must have made adjustments after testing it. The parsing of CSS time was throwing errors, even with valid CSS time arguments. Should be fine now.</p>
<h3 id="Other-Fixes"><a href="#Other-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="Other Fixes"></a>Other Fixes</h3><p>I made documentation fixes and patched up some dumb errors in the download utility. I also added the new macros to the downloader, the docs, and the demo.</p>
<h3 id="Next-Time-on-Custom-Macros-Z"><a href="#Next-Time-on-Custom-Macros-Z" class="headerlink" title="Next Time on Custom Macros Z"></a>Next Time on Custom Macros Z</h3><p>That rounds up the changes in v2.5.0. I have more ideas I’m considering, and I do jot down questions I see more than a few times, so I’m certainly not done yet in that respect. But I do feel like I’m starting to approach a line with the cycles system, the meter macros, and the speech boxes. As I close in on these more complex and specific use cases, I’m closing in on concepts that are probably better off with bespoke solutions. This narrows the band of people these macros are useful for.</p>
<p>Consider the fading macros or the dice roller functions. There’s real value in these even for people capable of building such systems themselves because it’s already done for them and because their results would likely look almost exactly like mine.</p>
<p>But with meters and speech boxes: why settle for someone else’s structure and the limitations and inconveniences they introduce when you can build a bespoke system from the ground up. Sure it takes a little longer, but you get exactly what you want and nothing extra and no wrestling with someone else’s stuff. This means that the people who benefit from these kinds of systems are specifically people who can’t build it themselves or people who just happen to be looking for similar aesthetics or setups to what I’m providing.</p>
<p>This isn’t a huge deal in and of itself, but it is why I’ve been hesitant to make certain systems, like health bars and conversation boxes, in the past even though they are frequently asked for. It’s why I remain hesitant on re-making a consumable-style inventory and why I’m still sitting on ideas to extend the simple inventory to handle stackable items and other item metadata. I’m not looking for guidance or advice on this, though I welcome thoughts, I just wanted to give a small window into how I’m thinking about these things.</p>

        <p>2019 was a pretty big year for Twine, and I think now is a great time to reflect on everything that’s happened. It’ll be helpful to me to collect my thoughts and talk through how I feel about the past year, but I think it’ll also help others get caught up on what’s been happening in the Twine community and ecosystem. </p>
<h2 id="Twine-2-3-0-and-Electron"><a href="#Twine-2-3-0-and-Electron" class="headerlink" title="Twine 2.3.0 and Electron"></a>Twine 2.3.0 and Electron</h2><p>Twine 2.3.0 entered beta in mid-December 2018, with a full release arriving in April 2019. This version of Twine represented a pretty massive change for the project, particularly the downloadable application version. Previous versions of the downloadable application version of Twine ran on the <a href="https://nwjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NW.js software</a>, a browser shell based on Chromium that allowed web applications to run kind of like native apps by using a dedicated, stripped down browser. Applications like this are often called “hybrid applications.” With version 2.3.0, Twine switched to a different browser shell (also based on Chromium) called <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electron</a>. Why? Well it’s complicated, but you can read <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/461#issuecomment-397844459" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this comment from Chris Klimas</a> for a very brief explanation.</p>
<p>As you may be able to imagine, a change this drastic in the underlying middleware of a fairly complicated app was a big deal and it took a few patches to smooth things over. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/bgufk9/twine_v231_is_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Posts over</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/devpx4/twine_v235_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/citsk8/twine_v233_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing each</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/d934ff/twine_v234_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.3.x release</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/comments/devpx4/twine_v235_now_available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track the story</a> if you’re interested. The big takeaway is that Twine 2.3.5 is now as stable as Twine has ever been.</p>
<p>Twine also now opens the test and play versions of your story in your default browser, which is a great change in my estimation. Subtle differences between the shells used by the Twine apps in the past and real browsers have always existed. These differences caused widely encountered issues in Twine 2.3.x, but it’s possible they could have caused issues anyway, so I think this change makes a lot of sense. Twine also now saves back-ups in case your main story files are corrupted or deleted. This feature was added due to a specific bug in the 2.3.0 release that was eating stories, but the Twine app has been known to eat stories outside of that bug, so this was another clever and welcome change.</p>
<p>What’s in store for version 2.4.0? Well, nothing too exciting, really. You can look at the plans so far <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/projects/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Chooseco-vs-the-World"><a href="#Chooseco-vs-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Chooseco vs the World"></a>Chooseco vs the World</h2><p><a href="https://www.cyoa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chooseco</a> is the company behind those <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books you maybe read as a kid. They own the term and, apparently, its acronym, “CYOA.” Lately, they’ve been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003455/chooseco-choose-your-own-adventure-itch-io-trademark-infringement-takedown-notices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting us know about it</a>. Also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18178846/netflix-black-mirror-bandersnatch-choose-your-own-adventure-book-trademark-lawsuit-chooseco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letting Netflix know about it</a>. In a way this is fair. Companies are required by US law to proactively defend their trademarks or risk losing them. But the loss of a useful descriptive term has been a bit of a blow to the Twine community. As an alternative, I suggest “choice-based.”</p>
<p>Note that it does not seem that Chooseco is actively suing any developers or anything like that, but instead trying to get people to stop using the terms. If you have a game published somewhere that is described as a “CYOA” or “Choose Your Own Adventure” consider changing that language in any official descriptions or in the game itself.</p>
<h2 id="Trademarking-Twine"><a href="#Trademarking-Twine" class="headerlink" title="Trademarking Twine"></a>Trademarking Twine</h2><p>Speaking of trademarks, the IFTF also officially trademarked the name “Twine” this year. What effect that has on the community, if any, remains to be seen. My guess is that this is not going to impact any of us in any major way, though referring to games as “Twines” or games made in other programs as “Twine games” may become a point of contention in the future.</p>
<h2 id="Goodbye-Q-amp-A"><a href="#Goodbye-Q-amp-A" class="headerlink" title="Goodbye Q&amp;A"></a>Goodbye Q&amp;A</h2><p>In late July, the <a href="https://twinery.org/questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twine Q&amp;A</a> was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8MlRGvri-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired from active duty</a> due to an overabundance of spam and a lack of time, manpower, and technology to deal with it. For reference, I was one of the mods. As bad as it looked to an end user, you don’t know the half of it. The Q&amp;A site still exists for users to search through and still appears in searches, so the answers written there are still available, much like <a href="https://twinery.org/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the old forum archive</a> before it.</p>
<p>Twine’s official online community is now <a href="https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/twine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Twine category at intfiction.org</a>. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twinegames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/n5dJvPp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> communities continue to exist as well.</p>
<h2 id="The-Twine-Resources-Guide"><a href="#The-Twine-Resources-Guide" class="headerlink" title="The Twine Resources Guide"></a>The Twine Resources Guide</h2><p>I released a <a href="https://resources.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">curated list of Twine resources</a> in June this year. While it’s my own guide so it may be a bit inappropriate to plug it here, it is, to my knowledge, the most exhaustive and well-tested list of its kind. You can make suggestions and contributions via its <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/twine-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo</a> if you’re so inclined.</p>
<h2 id="Flash-in-the-Pan"><a href="#Flash-in-the-Pan" class="headerlink" title="Flash in the Pan"></a>Flash in the Pan</h2><p>The <a href="https://twinery.org/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twine news</a> section of the official Twine website, meant to be a twice monthly report on the biggest happenings in the Twine universe ended in February 2019 after only five or so months of operation. This was a curious addition to the Twine website in the first place, in my opinion, as the Twine Twitter account seems like a better way to handle this, but I feel like it’s unceremonious end is just as curious. I don’t have much to talk about here, I just didn’t want this short-lived news section to be lost to the ages.</p>
<h2 id="Narrascope"><a href="#Narrascope" class="headerlink" title="Narrascope"></a>Narrascope</h2><p>I didn’t go to the first annual <a href="https://narrascope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Narrascope</a> conference that happened in June, but I’m glad it exists and I’m interested in going to one of them someday, should one happen in my neck of the woods. I do know a lot of people who went and several who spoke at the event and it generated a number of great blog posts. If you’re interested, this year’s conference is going to be held on May 29-31 in Urbana-Champaign, IL, and is accepting proposals from speakers through January 17.</p>
<p>Chris Klimas, creator of Twine, spoke at Narrascope 2019. <a href="http://chrisklimas.com/twine-past-present-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s his talk in blog post form.</a> I think it’s a fascinating read for anyone with more than a passive interest in Twine.</p>
<p>There’s also a Narrascope <a href="https://narrascope.org/pages/podcast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> now if that’s your thing.</p>
<h2 id="Harlowe-3"><a href="#Harlowe-3" class="headerlink" title="Harlowe 3"></a>Harlowe 3</h2><p>Harlowe 3 technically released late last year, two weeks before the year ended with the first beta release of Twine 2.3.0 in mid-December 2018. However, it wasn’t widely used until April this year when Twine 2.3.0 had its full release, so I’ll consider it a 2019 development for our purposes. </p>
<p>I’m not a fan of Harlowe 3. It’s just Harlowe 2, honestly. Changes I feel Harlowe desperately needs, like any kind of mobile support or responsive design, did not happen, and those changes are likely to be breaking for users, meaning there is a high chance we’ll have to wait for Harlowe 4 to see them, if we ever see them at all (I’m not holding my breath).</p>
<p>Other than that, Harlowe 3 now has a few input types like dropdowns and cycling links, but still doesn’t have actual text inputs and still uses ugly prompts (though the situation there has improved somewhat) even though users have been asking for textbox inputs for years now. I should clarify, the new input macros could support a traditional textbox-style input easily, Harlowe 3 just hasn’t added it yet (and again, I’m not holding my breath).</p>
<p>Overall, I was disappointed with the limited changes here, especially for a major version bump. I do think Harlowe has great ideas. I’ve dug pretty deep into its source code in developing <a href="https://hal.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HAL</a>, and I can assure you that there’s a stroke of genius every few lines.</p>
<p>But for as much brilliance is on display in some areas of Harlowe’s design, I think it is hamstrung by other design decisions. Decisions that box authors in, lock them out of any extensibility or options, or simply don’t make sense, like the aforementioned indefensible lack of responsiveness. Harlowe literally just needs a single line of HTML code to become responsive, but the so-called beginner format would instead force authors who want to fully support mobiles to manually add the line required. </p>
<p>In my opinion, Harlowe’s design decisions remain as at odds with themselves in version 3 as they were in version 1 and 2. It is a format that wants to be limited and focused and opinionated, but also strives to be as full-featured and wide-ranging as SugarCube. I think it’s spread too thin and I don’t know that it will ever strike that balance.</p>
<h2 id="SugarCube-2"><a href="#SugarCube-2" class="headerlink" title="SugarCube 2"></a>SugarCube 2</h2><p>SugarCube 2 is still mostly what you probably expect. It’s still the format that’s hardest to go wrong with. It’s still clunky, but straightforward, syntax-wise. It’s still powerful, simple, and packed with features, options, and extensibility. That’s not to say there haven’t been improvements this year, though.</p>
<p>First, the <code>SimpleAudio</code> API is now fully documented, giving authors the ability to more easily leverage SugarCube’s audio subsystem from JavaScript code. SugarCube has also added a <code>Template</code> API and syntax for text replacements and now features a new <code>State.metadata</code> API that replaces the <code>&lt;&lt;remember&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;forget&gt;&gt;</code> macros. Improved documentation rounds out the changes we’ve seen from the format over the year.</p>
<p>So, all-in-all, nothing life changing, but the releases this year, particularly v2.29.0 in June, have been impactful and full of features and improvements.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I still recommend SugarCube 2 for most Twine users and that’s on track to continue throughout 2020. It’s as simple, or nearly so, as Harlowe, almost as extensible as Snowman, and it has the deepest bench of features, options, and functionality. It’s just so hard to go wrong with SugarCube.</p>
<h2 id="Snowman-2"><a href="#Snowman-2" class="headerlink" title="Snowman 2"></a>Snowman 2</h2><p>Snowman has impressed me this year. Chris Klimas has moved to developing Chapbook (more on that in a moment) and handed development duties for Snowman off to Twine guru and <a href="https://twinery.org/cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cookbook</a> editor <a href="https://videlais.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Cox (AKA Videlais)</a>, who has been working on developing <a href="https://videlais.github.io/snowman/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a second major version of the format</a> and <a href="https://videlais.github.io/snowman/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providing <strong>actual documentation</strong> for the first version</a>.</p>
<p>Snowman 2 does make a small handful of changes I don’t like, but by and large it’s mostly just added some conveniences, features, and functions that make the format more usable by more people. Snowman was always meant to be minimal, and I think that central design concept needs to be respected. But I think you could argue that Snowman was <em>too</em> minimal in its first incarnation. I think adding a few bells and whistles is a great idea and is likely to make the format more appealing to the advanced users it was meant to attract.</p>
<p>Under this new direction, I think Snowman is gonna be a format to keep your eye on in 2020. That’s not to knock the solid base provided by Chris, but I do feel like Snowman was stagnant at best for the past few years and I’m excited to see where it ends up.</p>
<h2 id="Chapbook"><a href="#Chapbook" class="headerlink" title="Chapbook"></a>Chapbook</h2><p>I love the idea of Chapbook even though I have some issues with its implementation and execution. I think that Chapbook could become what I feel like Harlowe should be, and that’s massively exciting to me, because there’s value in a simple, opinionated, somewhat limited story format. I feel that Chapbook fully commits to being different and more focused, whereas Harlowe seems to want to simultaneously compete with SugarCube’s wide-ranging design and provide a slimmer, more focused feature set. Where Harlowe is, in my estimation, at odds with itself, Chapbook strikes a completely different balance that has long been foreign to Twine. Or at least it’s on the way to doing that.</p>
<p>Chapbook has a neat backstage feature that provides the best built-in testing features in any Twine story format, with live updates, styling options, variable editing, and all sorts of other goodies, which is a stroke of genius, especially since you can omit all the backstage code to slim down your game when you go on to release it. Backstage is excellent and has no downsides.</p>
<p>My issues with Chapbook are mostly in the inconvenient way it handles control logic like if statements. Sure it has conditional assignment via the JavaScript ternary operator and a few other conveniences, but this limitation coupled with enforced separation of variable control and story content mean that it can be a challenge to make logic-heavy games compared to the other formats. I am also concerned by the fact that all variables are global unless you namespace them yourself (a sharp edge less experienced coders are likely to get cut on), that saves are automatic and very outside author control, and that Chapbook seems to lack a history system or a rewind/undo feature. </p>
<p>Taken together, I’m more excited to see what Chapbook evolves into throughout 2020 than I am to use it right now. I think the promise of what Chapbook could become is more exciting than what it is right now, but I don’t want to belittle what it is right now either. It is a bold, new direction for Twine story formats that does challenge some of the core concepts we expect, and I think that’s very much worth celebrating.</p>
<h2 id="Paperthin"><a href="#Paperthin" class="headerlink" title="Paperthin"></a>Paperthin</h2><p>I think Paperthin should be replaced by <a href="http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Illume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illume</a> or <a href="https://poof.twinelab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poof</a> (yes, I made poof, so I’m biased, but I <em>hate</em> Paperthin). We should bug Chris on Twitter about this. Otherwise, Paperthin remained bad throughout 2019 (it hasn’t changed since it was made, honestly). It still doesn’t let you print or copy paste passage titles along with passage content, and is basically useless.</p>
<h2 id="Twee-Compilers"><a href="#Twee-Compilers" class="headerlink" title="Twee Compilers"></a>Twee Compilers</h2><p>It’s no secret to anyone who knows me that I prefer working with Twee and command-line compilers to the Twine application any day of the week. And this was a big year for Twee and Twee compilers. First, we finally got <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official Twee3 specification</a> so that tools using Twee can now enjoy greater interoperability and developers of such tools actually know what the rules are.</p>
<p>In response to the new Twee3 spec, <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tweego 2</a> (by Thomas Michael Edwards, developer of SugarCube) and <a href="https://github.com/videlais/extwee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extwee</a> (by Dan Cox/Videlais, developer of Snowman and editor of the Twine Cookbook) were also released this year. While I still prefer Tweego overall, I really like Extwee, and that it’s an NPM package is sure to make it super tempting to some authors. It also has built in transpilation and minification, things I do anyway. I think there’s a chance it tries to do too much stuff at once for some people, but for most users, these are good choices and good inclusions. Tweego on the whole is more mature and has more features, though.</p>
<p>Other Twine specs are also in the works, so the future of third party tools for Twine is looking particularly bright for 2020. As a developer of a few such third party tools, I can’t begin to express how nice it is to have some real specifications.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>2019 was a pretty big year for Twine, and I think looking back on it helps us see where we may be going, and how we’re going to get there. So let’s speculate a bit.</p>
<p>First, I don’t think we’ll see any big changes in the Twine app next year like we did this year with the jump to Electron. I do think 2.4.0 will arrive sometime next year, but I don’t foresee major or dramatic changes in the way we use the app, in how it feels to use, or in its underlying tech.</p>
<p>I don’t have any specific expectations for the story formats outside the normal updates we tend to see over time. I wouldn’t expect a Harlowe 4. I would expect Chapbook to change a lot over the course of 2020. Don’t hold your breath for a SugarCube 3, though <a href="https://trello.com/b/lw6z5bUF/sugarcube-todo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Trello for SugarCube</a> should help you manage your expectations for what’s coming in SugarCube 2. There’s only so much you can add to a format that’s meant to be minimal, so I also wouldn’t expect Snowman 2 to get more than maybe a handful of additional convenience features. Dan Cox has shown a willingness to rethink parts of Snowman, though, so I’d still keep an eye on it in 2020.</p>
<p>I think we’ll see more custom story formats and other tools for Twine now that there’s actually documentation on Twine’s HTML data chunk, documentation on developing story formats, and a proper spec for Twee. I don’t expect things to suddenly explode, but having these things documented is step one in expanding the base of people who are capable of experimenting with them. I had to read source code to figure out how to make poof. I think now that you don’t have to do that, there’s no reason why other community members won’t start making their own tools.</p>
<p>Finally, I wouldn’t sweat Chooseco’s crack down too much, or Twine’s trademark. Chooseco has to protect their brand–that I, and many others, I’m sure, think of Twine or other computer software when I hear “CYOA” or “Choose Your Own Adventure” is proof of that. Likewise, I think Twine should be more proactive in protecting its own brand. Any old schlub can come along and make a website with the brand name in it, after all*. </p>
<p>I’m interested in hearing from others, too. I may release a follow up to this piece in early 2020 where I cover some of the things I missed in this article, but also some things I haven’t touched on, like game releases. If you have ideas or know something I don’t, leave a comment or drop me a line. I’m also interested in what Twine games you’ve played that were released this year and what you thought of them.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for reading. Happy holidays and happy new year.</p>
<p>*Note: I actually doubt that TwineLab.net would run afoul of this trademark.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This update consists largely of internal improvements geared toward optimizing performance, particularly when proofing large Twine projects. A JSON export feature was also added, along with a few minor UI tweaks to improve consistency across window and screen sizes. Finally, Snowman now has a second major version which adds some additional global functions, so a linting profile for Snowman v2.x was added.</p>
<p>The biggest change that effects users is the new JSON export. For the uninitiated, JSON is a data format that can be imported into various programs and tools. Only passage data is sent. By default, passage source code, tags, pids, and titles are included in the data, but you can optionally include extra metadata, including passage position, size, raw tag data, and passage reference data as understood by poof. You can also elect to pretty print the output file, making it more human readable. </p>
<p>Settings regarding the JSON export have been added to <code>poof.config</code>. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Other than keeping on top of any bugs my optimizations may have caused here, I don’t have any solid plans for right now. I do envision the possibility of a major UI overhaul, but I don’t know what I want that to look like, only that I’m not completely pleased with what we have right now. Changes that drastic may require a version 2.0.0, though, in case people prefer the current interface to whatever I may come up with. If I <em>do</em> make a v2, though, I want to rewrite more than just the UI, and I don’t want to undertake any massive projects on poof for right now, so those ideas are on hold at present.</p>
<p>As always, I’m open to suggestions, ideas, and contributions.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>HAL v2 is here. This version represents a fairly large refactor of most of the code base, many usability improvements, and some improved or additional functionality. It also, unfortunately, means that some code written for HAL v1 <em>may</em> no longer work, or work slightly differently. I kept the APIs as similar as possible, but some behavior may not always be as you expect, so if you decide to upgrade from v1, test carefully and keep the docs on hand. </p>
<h2 id="Special-Passages"><a href="#Special-Passages" class="headerlink" title="Special Passages"></a>Special Passages</h2><p>HAL v2 now uses <em>special passages</em> both to configure the library and to set up track definitions. </p>
<p>The <code>hal.config</code> special passage is the new way to configure HAL. You no longer have to hand-edit the libraries source code, which was a hack-y nightmare, especially when you needed to upgrade to a new version. <strong>Do not</strong> attempt to hand-edit the source code anymore. </p>
<p>The <code>hal.tracks</code> special passage is the new, recommended way for users to define tracks and assign them source files. The old <code>A.newTrack()</code> method is still available and still works, and is joined by the <code>(newtrack:)</code> macro, so you have options if you want them. </p>
<h2 id="Macros"><a href="#Macros" class="headerlink" title="Macros"></a>Macros</h2><p>HAL v2 adds a number of <em>custom macros</em> to the library that allow you to use macro code to interact with HAL instead of JavaScript. </p>
<p>The macros are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(masteraudio:)</code></li>
<li><code>(newtrack:)</code></li>
<li><code>(newplaylist:)</code></li>
<li><code>(newgroup:)</code></li>
<li><code>(track:)</code></li>
<li><code>(playlist:)</code></li>
<li><code>(group:)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Details on the macros are in <a href="https://hal.twinelab.net/#/v2#custom-macros-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="The-Guide"><a href="#The-Guide" class="headerlink" title="The Guide"></a>The Guide</h2><p>In addition to rewritten reference documentation, HAL now includes a gentler <a href="https://hal.twinelab.net/#/#guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide</a> to help get novices acclimated quickly with just the info needed to get started. Docs for v1 are <a href="https://hal.twinelab.net/#/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still available</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Please-Report-Problems"><a href="#Please-Report-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Please Report Problems"></a>Please Report Problems</h2><p>Changes this big rarely go <em>completely</em> smoothly. If you find any bugs or other issues, please report them on <a href="https://github.com/ChapelR/harlowe-audio/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the issue tracker</a>.</p>

        <p>This release updates a few macros, adds one new macro set, and features a few meta and documentation updates.</p>
<h3 id="The-Articles-Macro-Set"><a href="#The-Articles-Macro-Set" class="headerlink" title="The Articles Macro Set"></a>The Articles Macro Set</h3><p>This is a new macro set than tries to figure out and append macros to strings. Overall, I feel pretty clever: the macro will correctly determine the articles in pretty complex situations, like “a UFO”, “an X”, “an honor”, and “an 8”.</p>
<h3 id="Pronoun-Templates-Update"><a href="#Pronoun-Templates-Update" class="headerlink" title="Pronoun Templates Update"></a>Pronoun Templates Update</h3><p>Not yet finished with my English language programming battle, I tackled pluralizing third person pronouns for the pronoun templates system. Again, it’s pretty clever, successfully getting “die” from “dies” and “fly” from “flies.” I was going to bundle this macro as an add-on, but it’s not terribly large so I built it in.</p>
<h3 id="Dialog-API-Macro-Set-Update"><a href="#Dialog-API-Macro-Set-Update" class="headerlink" title="Dialog API Macro Set Update"></a>Dialog API Macro Set Update</h3><p>The <code>&lt;&lt;dialog&gt;&gt;</code> macro has two new child tags: <code>&lt;&lt;onopen&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;onclose&gt;&gt;</code> that let you run code when a dialog is opened or closed.</p>
<h3 id="Documentation-Updates"><a href="#Documentation-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Documentation Updates"></a>Documentation Updates</h3><p>I fixed a few errors and organized the list of macros int groups for easier reading.</p>
<h3 id="Download-Utility"><a href="#Download-Utility" class="headerlink" title="Download Utility"></a>Download Utility</h3><p>This update adds a <a href="https://macros.twinelab.net/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download utility</a> that allows you build customized downloads to simplify the installation process, an idea I’ve been tossing around for a while. Just select the macros / scripts you want and click the download button and the utility will spit out a zip file containing a single JavaScript file and (in some cases) a single CSS file that you can then add to your project. This will become the recommended way to download custom macros going forward.</p>

        <p>A handful of usability improvements and a few new passage tag features round out what is mostly and internal upgrade here. The most obvious update for most users will be that the view settings have been moved out of the view menu, making the view menu completely dedicated to switching between the passage, JavaScript, and stylesheet views. The view options are now in their own little settings menu with checkbox-like inputs.</p>
<p>I edited the CSS for tags in the passage card. Tags now also come with a little box displaying their tag color from the Twine 2 editor, and clicking on a tag now performs a filtering operation using that tag, just as if you had used <code>Tools &gt; Filter...</code> and typed in the tag’s name. You can now also clear filters by clicking the so-named button on the top-right of the passage view whenever any filtering is enabled.</p>
<p>I also ironed out a few graphical bugs with how certain combinations of view options interacted and a few other rare and non-critical bugs I found.</p>
<p>Poof also now has official internal support for Chapbook. Chapbook inserts that reference other passages have been added to the parser, and most of its globals have been added to the linter configuration.</p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>I want to improve poof’s accessibility and usability, so some updates regarding that will probably be coming in the future. I also need to stay on top of Chapbook&mdash;it’s still in beta, so I intend to keep an eye on it and address any changes I need to on poof’s parser or linter.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This is a pretty big update, so we’re gonna break this all into chunks and go through it piece-by-piece. As a brief overview, the changes are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Three brand new macros / macro sets / scripts. </li>
<li>One additional system from v1.x of the collection has been rewritten and re-added: the cycles system. </li>
<li>Several scripts have been refactored to better adhere to best practices, improve performance, and rise to my evolving standard for code quality. These changes are internal and shouldn’t effect you as a user. </li>
<li>The documentation has been improved, and the collection how has a dedicated web page at <a href="https://macros.twinelab.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://macros.twinelab.net</a> </li>
<li>A <a href="https://twinelab.net/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/demo/">demo project</a> to show off the basic functionality of each system. </li>
<li>Finally, a <a href="https://twinelab.net/custom-macros-for-sugarcube-2/#/changelog">changelog</a> has been added so that changes can be tracked more easily. The v2.3.0 update represents the biggest update since v2.0.0, so it seemed wise to start documenting these changes more clearly. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="New-Systems"><a href="#New-Systems" class="headerlink" title="New Systems"></a>New Systems</h2><p>I’ve added a <code>&lt;&lt;css&gt;&gt;</code> macro that lets authors programmatically customize the CSS style rules of elements on the page. This is still the <em>worst</em> way to change CSS, but it is useful in certain scenarios. </p>
<p>The next addition is the meters macro set. It gives authors access to fully customizable meters for things like health bars, timers, and progress bars, all in SugarCube macro code. It has a few stipulations and limitations you need to be aware of to make good use of it, but I think it works well for what it is. It also includes a JavaScript API if you’re into that sort of thing. </p>
<p>The final addition are the pronoun templates, a complete, drop-in pronoun configuration system for SugarCube leveraging the brand new <code>Template</code> API and syntax, and it can plug in to the <code>Setting</code> API as well. </p>
<h2 id="The-Cycles-System-v2"><a href="#The-Cycles-System-v2" class="headerlink" title="The Cycles System v2"></a>The Cycles System v2</h2><p>The new cycles system is similar to, but better, than the old implementation. Code written for the old system will not be compatible with this one. Check the docs for more on how the new system works and how you may need to update your code. </p>
<p>The only other system that is worth bringing forward to v2 is the consumables inventory system. If I do so, it will be as an extension to the existing Simple Inventory v2.x system. </p>
<h2 id="Refactored-Scripts"><a href="#Refactored-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Refactored Scripts"></a>Refactored Scripts</h2><p>The Simple Inventory, the Playtime system, the operations API (the dice roller and fairmath systems), and the fullscreen macros have all been refactored. Only the fullscreen macros and operations API have seen any end-user changes, in the form of a proper JavaScript-facing API for the former and support for Fate/Fudge dice for the latter (e.g., <code>&quot;2dF&quot;</code>). That said, all of these systems should now be more stable and perform better, and their code should conform better to best practices. </p>
<h2 id="Documentation-Changes"><a href="#Documentation-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Documentation Changes"></a>Documentation Changes</h2><p>In addition to a shiny new website, much of the documentation has been clarified, improved, and fixed and several new examples have been added to several pages, while previously undocumented features have stabilized and been documented. </p>
<p>You don’t <em>need</em> to re-read any of the docs, as none of the changes are specifically breaking. </p>
<h2 id="The-Demo-Project"><a href="#The-Demo-Project" class="headerlink" title="The Demo Project"></a>The Demo Project</h2><p>The demo project includes demonstrations and examples of the <em>basic</em> usage of each system, and provides source code for each example passage, so that users can see how exactly each example is put together on the code side. </p>
<p>Links to the demo and each relevant passage are in the documentation. </p>
<h2 id="The-Changelog"><a href="#The-Changelog" class="headerlink" title="The Changelog"></a>The Changelog</h2><p>The changelog is mostly accurate to my recollection, though there may be some gaps or inconsistencies between it and the repo’s commit history. Since I typically only create releases when a system is retired, given the nature of this project, some changes that happened over short periods of time or weren’t given specific version numbers (e.g., fixed typos in the docs) have been retroactively bundled together and given a version number. </p>
<p>Going forward, I intend to follow semantic versioning a little more closely for the sake of everyone’s sanity. </p>

        <p>This version of HAL comes with a few important updates for greater compatibility with Harlowe 3, and fixes you’ll want even if you’ve stuck to Harlowe 2. </p>
<p>The biggest addition is that HAL now preserves and restores it’s own state separately from Harlowe. In Harlowe 2, reloading the browser simply restarted the game, and this restarted HAL along with it. Loading a saved game had no meaningful effect on HAL. In Harlowe 3, browser reloads now preserve Harlowe’s state, but not in a way similar to loading a saved game. Instead, Harlowe reconstructs the history in a different way that completely ignores startup passages, meaning HAL tracks, playlists, and groups set up in such passages break even though the game itself is fine, and this failure was not handled well. </p>
<p>Now, HAL will attempt to preserve it’s own state and restore it. This preservation only applies to tracks, playlists, and groups, and restores the ability of authors to use startup passages with these features. </p>
<p>The menu API, however, cannot be easily serialized, and therefore must always be defined in user scripts. </p>
<p>It is still gently recommended that you try to stick to Story JavaScript as much as possible, but this change should make it so you no longer <em>have</em> to rewrite code that was valid for Harlowe 2. </p>
<p>Some other bug fixes, updates, and internal improvements are also included in this release, so it’s recommended you update even if the above problem wasn’t an issue for you. </p>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>I will continue monitoring issue and clashes with Harlowe v3 and look into reported issues on mobile devices.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Poof v1.3.0 has arrived. In addition to dozens of small changes and improvements, the big news here is <em>passage references</em> and an updated Twee encoder.</p>
<p>A passage reference is, as you may imagine, when one of your passages references another passage through a link, include/display, or goto. Poof will parse SugarCube and Harlowe stories for a certain subset of common macros used to transition passages as well as for markup links (e.g., <code>[[links like this]]</code>). The macros parsed are not exhaustive–for example, SugarCube’s <code>&lt;&lt;textbox&gt;&gt;</code> macro can send users to new passages, but is not parsed by poof because there has to be a cutoff somewhere. JavaScript functions and methods that transition passages are also not parsed. Additionally, poof can only parse <em>string literals</em>. So, <code>&lt;&lt;link &#39;Next&#39; &#39;some passage&#39;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;</code> will work, but <code>&lt;&lt;link &#39;Next&#39; $somePassage&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;</code> will not.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things poof will try to parse for valid passage references in each format:</p>
<h4 id="All-Formats"><a href="#All-Formats" class="headerlink" title="All Formats"></a>All Formats</h4><ul>
<li>Markup links of any kind, including arrow markup links (<code>[[passage&lt;-text]]</code>).</li>
<li>Setter links. Even though these are only supported by default by SugarCube, poof will try to parse setter links when it sees them regardless of the format.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Harlowe"><a href="#Harlowe" class="headerlink" title="Harlowe"></a>Harlowe</h4><ul>
<li><code>(link-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(click-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(link-reveal-goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(goto:)</code></li>
<li><code>(include:)</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="SugarCube"><a href="#SugarCube" class="headerlink" title="SugarCube"></a>SugarCube</h4><ul>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;link&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;button&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;goto&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;display&gt;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Poof will display passage references to and from each passage as links you can click to zoom to those passages, allowing you to essentially play along with your game while editing. This is my solution to requests for a “play order” sorting method.</p>
<p>Note that parsing for passage references is somewhat slow. You cna shut this feature off if you’d prefer faster load times to having it via <code>poof.config</code>.</p>
<p>The second change here is the Twee encoder. Poof now exports to classic Twee, the Twee2 version of Twee (previously unsupported) and <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new Twee3 spec</a>. This last spec is still a draft and is widely unsupported, so the default is still set to Twee classic for now. You can change the Twee encoder in the <code>poof.config</code> special passage.</p>
<p>The smaller changes included in this update are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a starting passage tool to quickly zoom you to the starting passage,</li>
<li>updates to SugarCube globals for the linter,</li>
<li>a bunch of other internal and code-side improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="In-future-releases"><a href="#In-future-releases" class="headerlink" title="In future releases:"></a>In future releases:</h2><p>Eventually Twee3 will be the default Twee encoder. SugarCube is also undergoing fairly major changes in v2.29.0, so I’ll be updating poof’s SugarCube support a lot. This will mostly be maintenance though.</p>
<h2 id="Note-on-Twine-v2-3-2"><a href="#Note-on-Twine-v2-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Note on Twine v2.3.2:"></a>Note on Twine v2.3.2:</h2><p>Twine v2.3.2 currently has a bug in how it handles proofing formats, see <a href="https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a>. This means if you want to use poof, you need to use an older version of Twine 2 until this gets sorted out.</p>
